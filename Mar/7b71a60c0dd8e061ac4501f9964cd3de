The Department of State Services (DSS) has raised alerted the public of an alleged plot by some elements to cause civil unrest in parts of the country, particularly in the North Central. This was contained in a statement made available to newsmen in Abuja by the Spokesperson of the Service, Dr Peter Afunanya. According to him, “the aim is to cause the ethno-religious crisis, ignite reprisals and heat up the polity. In a bid to achieve this, the sponsors have mobilised foot soldiers and held several meetings in and outside the target areas. “The Service is also aware of a plot to use students, striking University teachers, labour unions, disgruntled individuals and strategic groups as well as exploit the global energy situation to carry out a mass protest like the #EndSARS. This is despite ongoing efforts by Government to address the issues.” IN CASE YOU MISSED THESE FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE According to the statement, “while the Service views the machination as unpatriotic, it is on the trail of the agents of destabilisation who are desirous of using violence to achieve ulterior goals.” It stated that though it has emplaced measures to disrupt these tendencies, it warmed the ring leaders and their cohorts to desist from acts capable of causing a breakdown of law and order. It assured the members of the public that the Service would in conjunction with other security agencies, go after the sponsors of the scheme and ensure the law takes its course. The Service advised citizens not only to engage according to rules but should resist persuasions to be used to destroy their own country, warning that those who might wish to go contrary to the law would be dealt with according to the law of the land.
