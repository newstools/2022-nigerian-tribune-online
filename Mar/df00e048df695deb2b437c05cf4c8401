Contrary to reports that Muhammad Amin Mahmood, a contestant for APC North West Youth Leader, was killed by bandits when they attacked the Abuja-Kaduna bound train, the man has come out to reveal that he is still alive. Mahmood, who was one of the passengers in the train that was attacked on Monday, disclosed on his Twitter handle on Tuesday that though he sustained injuries in the incident, he is very much alive. One of the online reports had said: “Muhammad Amin Mahmood, who was an aspirant in the just-concluded APC Convention for the Northwest Zonal Youth Leadership position, was among seven passengers confirmed dead on the Abuja-Kaduna train attacks.” However, according to his series of tweets following the news of his death on social media, he is still very much alive as he is currently receiving treatment at a medical facility. “Good day ladies and gentlemen. Special gratitude goes to Almighty Allah. This is to debunk media reports that I was shot dead. I only sustained an injury from gunshot on my thigh. I am presently receiving treatment at a medical facility. “I sincerely appreciate those that prayed and sent in their words of consolation.
