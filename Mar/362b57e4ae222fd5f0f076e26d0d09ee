My 10 –year- old son, who has been in boarding school for just two months, came home with itchy skin rashes which is worse at night.  The doctor diagnosed him with Scabies but I did not believe the doctor because my son is very clean. Can this be scabies? Dauda (by E Mail)  Yes, it looks like Scabies. The disease is usually very rampant in boarding schools and enclosed communities such as prison yards and hospitals. In addition to the use of anti-scabies medications, improvement in personal hygiene, including the disinfection and sometimes outright burning of beddings and mattresses, are also very important.
