OUT of total of 68 bills recommended by the special ad hoc committee on constitution review, only 45 clauses successfully scaled through at both the Senate and House of Representatives. While members of the House of Representatives voted in support of 56 clauses, the senators voted in support of 47. Both chambers unanimously rejected the proposals to expand immunity to the legislative and judicial arms of government; provide pension for presiding officers of the National Assembly; provide for diaspora voting; further define Acts that constitute torture, inhuman or degrading treatment and the bill seeking to provide criteria for qualification to become an indigene of a state in Nigeria. They also rejected the proposals to provide for special seat for women in the national and state houses of assembly; include Value Added Tax on the exclusive legislative list; provide for the procedure of removing presiding officers of the legislature; and the bill to change the name Barkin Ladi Local Government Area.

The ongoing advocacy to ensure devolution of powers also gained a boost as the senators and members of the House of Representatives separately passed the bills which seek to move airports; fingerprints, identification and criminal records; prisons (which is to be redesignated as correctional service) and railway from the exclusive legislative list to the concurrent legislative list. In the same vein, both chambers passed the bills which seek to empower the Revenue Mobilisation, Allocation and Fiscal Commission (RMAFC) to enforce compliance with remittance of accruals into and disbursement of revenue from the Federation Account and streamline the procedure for reviewing the revenue allocation formula; enhance the independence of certain bodies; remove transitional lawmaking powers from the executive arms of government.

Others include bills which seek to wmpower the National Assembly and state houses of Assembly to summon the president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and governors of states to answer questions on issues on which the national and state houses of Assembly have the powers to make law; reduce the period within which the president or the governor of a state may authorise the withdrawal of money from the Consolidated Revenue Fund in the absence of an Appropriations Act from six months to three months; establish the Office of the Accountant–General of the Federal Government, separate from the Office of the Accountant–General of the Federation; establish the Office of the Attorney–General of the Federation and of the state separate from the Office of the minister of justice or commissioners for justice of the state, in order to make the offices of the Attorneys–General independent and insulated from partisanship; provide for a state of the nation and state of the state address by the president and governor; replace the Consolidated Revenue Fund of the Federation with the Consolidated Revenue Fund of the Federal Government; specify the timeframe for the conduct of population census and include former heads of the National Assembly in the Council of State.

However, the Senate rejected the bills which seek to provide for the procedure for passing a constitution alteration bill where the president withhold assent; establish the federal revenue court and the revenue court of a state; provide the procedure for overriding executive veto in respect of money bill; further strengthen the judiciary for timely dispensation of justice; provide the timelines within which civil and criminal cases are heard and determined at trial and appellate courts in order to eliminate unnecessary delay in justice administration and delivery; allow court or tribunal proceedings to be conducted remotely, virtually, online or through any media platform or technological innovation; include judges of the National Industrial Court in the composition of election tribunal; provide for the termination of tenure of certain elected officials on account of a change of political party; appointment of mayor for FCT and Mmnister from the FCT; establish the National and State Councils of Traditional Rulers to advise the president and governors on matters related to customs, security and public order and provide a minimum percentage for women in ministerial or commissioner-nominees.
