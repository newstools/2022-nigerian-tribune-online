A fire outbreak on Monday engulfed a building in Javino, an area of Gauraka in Tafa Local Government Area of Niger State. Some eyewitnesses told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that the inferno was caused by activities at the building where petrol was stored illegally. With fuel scarcity in the country, the owner of the goods was said to also store diesel in tanks for sale to customers as ‘black market’. According to an eyewitness, the owner at about 6:35 a.m. attempted to use a pumping machine to fill an iron keg leading to the fire outbreak. The fire rose to consume other tanks containing petrol and diesel, a few shops around and the roof of a building under construction. After about 30 minutes of inferno, the Niger State Fire Service arrived at the scene to salvage the situation but ran out of water shortly after. A private organisation, Empire Energy Limited that was close by, was alerted and arrived with its fire truck and helped quench the fire completely. Linda Albert, one of the eyewitnesses, who spoke on the incident, said: “Early this morning, we heard fire and we came out, it was really a bad sight but we thank God that the fire is out. “If the government can help us take these people away from here. This is a residential area and imagine if this fire incident started in the night, lives would have been lost.” https://www.portal.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Fire-outbreak-at-Suleja.mp4?_=1 ORITAMEFA BAPTIST MODEL SCHOOLS, (OBMS), IBADAN
