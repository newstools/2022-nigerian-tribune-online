SEVEN children died while several others sustained injuries during a stampede in Shimfida village of Jibia Local Government Area of Katsina State. Sources said the stampede occurred following a report that bandits had stormed the area. It was gathered that on Thursday, a joint security task force in the area was withdrawn from the community. Findings gathered that the withdrawn soldiers were initially stationed at the Government Secondary School, Shimfida, about 27 kilometres from Jibia town. However, the residents were said to have become apprehensive once they discovered the community would become vulnerable. Thus, the residents began to pack their belongings and relocate to neighbouring villages and towns. However, those who stayed behind were attacked by the bandits and in the ensuing stampede, seven children were reported to have died. As of the time of filing this report, there was no statement from the police or the state government. ORITAMEFA BAPTIST MODEL SCHOOLS, (OBMS), IBADAN
