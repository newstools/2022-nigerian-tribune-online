Former Big Brother Naija housemate and businesswoman, Tega Offiong Dominic-Ajeboh, popularly known as Tega has finally broken the silence about her marital status as she announced on social media that her marriage ended in 2020, which was before the show. In 2021, during the ‘Shine Ya Eye’ edition of the Big Brother Naija show, Tega was the talk of the town when she had deep intimate relationship with fellow housemate, Boma Akpore, having presented herself as a married woman outside the house. Since leaving the house in 2021, there had been speculations that her marriage was no longer intact as her husband was not pleased with her acts in the Big Brother Naija house. Tega, however, broke the silence recently when she replied a follower on Instagram who asked if she was still married that her marriage ended in 2020. “Lol, no I am not, ended since 2020. All you know was a move that went wrong, actually it ended since 2020. Now you all can get off my back, thanks,” the mother of one responded to the question about her marital status.
