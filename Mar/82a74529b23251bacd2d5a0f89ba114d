The company’s shareholders’ fund also grew by 16 per cent from N47.6 billion to N55.1 billion after paying dividends totalling N3.24 billion, amounting to 50 Kobo per share during the year. The audited result of the company and its subsidiaries has confirmed the growth in revenue and shareholders’ funds for the year that ended on December 31, 2021, as earlier reported in the unaudited result released on 31st January 2022. The report showed that major business segments posted appreciable revenue and profit growths despite the challenging operating environment. In line with the tradition of the company on the payment of regular dividends to its shareholders, the directors recommended the payment of a final dividend of 40 kobo per share on every 50 kobo share of the company, having paid an interim dividend of 10 kobo per share in September 2021, thus taking the total dividend paid on the result for the financial year 2021 to 50 kobo per share.
