A 25-year-old woman, Sadiya, has dragged her father, M. Usman, before a Shari’a court sitting at Rigasa, Kaduna, Kaduna State,  for allegedly forcing her into a loveless marriage. The complainant, who resides in Rigasa area of Kaduna, told the court that the marriage was her third. “My father arranged and forced me to marry without first knowing the man I was marrying. “My first, second and third marriage were all forced marriages arranged by my father. “I can’t continue like this. I want the court to dissolve the marriage,” she said. She told the court that she currently lives with someone at Unguwan Sarki area of the state. On his part, the defendant said that his daughter brought the man home but later rejected him. “Her claim that she does not know him is untrue. “I don’t know where my daughter is currently staying. She left my house on the day of the wedding. “I am pray the court to order her to return home as soon as possible,” he said. The judge, Malam Salisu Abubakar-Tureta did not accept the prayers of the defendant but ordered the complainant to stay under the custody of the district head of Rigasa. He then adjourned the case for the complainant to present her witnesses. ORITAMEFA BAPTIST MODEL SCHOOLS, (OBMS), IBADAN
