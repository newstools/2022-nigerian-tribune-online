THE Olu of Warri, Ogiame Atuwatse, has predicted that Ogun State will soon join the oil- producing states as oil and other petrol-carbon products will be discovered in the state. The monarch made the prediction when he paid a courtesy call on the governor of the state, Dapo Abiodun, at the Presidential Lodge in Abeokuta. The Olu said the state has all it takes to be an oil- producing state just like the states in the Niger Delta. “When our forefathers left the riverside to where we are now, they scooped the water and when they got to Warri, they dropped the water there. When they came back to the riverside, they also scooped water from Warri and dropped it in riverside and since we have oil in Warri, I am sure oil is also here. “I want to predict that very soon, oil will be discovered in this state and you will also join us in that club. When this happens, I will be here to celebrate with you,” the monarch stated. He explained that his visit was to identify with the people of Yoruba land, as Warri people regard themselves as part of the Yoruba stock.
