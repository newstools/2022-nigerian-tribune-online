The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is an important macroeconomic indicator that provides a general measure of changes in prices of consumer goods and services purchased by households, and the inflation rate is directly computed from the CPI. Accordingly, the CPI is used for many different purposes, such as being one of the important inputs in the formulation and revision of socio-economic and monetary policies; adjustment in wages and salaries in many sectors; adjustment of some government benefits and contracted payments such as salaries and contract prices.
