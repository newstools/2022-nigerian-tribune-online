No fewer than about 3,565 smallholder farmers, about 165 Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and five lead farmers in Niger State have received the sum of N295 million from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Covid-19 mitigation grants. The Senior Programme Officer, Cash Transfer Programme, Rural Resilience Activity, Christiana Stephen Wakawa stated this on Monday in Minna at a COVID-19 Mitigation Grant Closeout Meeting with traditional rulers and other stakeholders (beneficiaries) held in Minna, the state capital. Wakawa noted that the beneficiaries compromised 3,565 smallholder farmers, 165 SMEs, and five lead firms in agro-businesses, adding that about five cowpea processors in the state were still waiting to be paid their own grants pending when they are able to give the exact cost of the equipment they need. Wakawa explained that the beneficiaries under the smallholder farmers and SMEs got N78,000 each while each of the five lead firms in agro-businesses was given N1 million, making it a total of N5 million for the lead farmers. She said the cowpea processors were yet to be disbursed, but the donor agency was already working out modalities for them to also get the grant. The programme officer said the USAID’s Rural Resilience Activity was a five-year programme targeting rural farmers with emphasis on women and youths to mitigate the negative impact of Covid-19 by assisting them to start up businesses or expand the existing ones.
