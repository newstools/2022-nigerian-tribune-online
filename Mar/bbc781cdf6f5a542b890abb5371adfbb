Fourteen passengers on Thursday escaped death as an 18-seater commercial bus conveying them caught fire on the motion at Koko Araromi area, along Ajase Ipo road in the Irepodun local government area of Kwara state. Tribune Online gathered that the Toyota Hiace bus caught fire due to fuel leakage to the vehicle’s exhaust part, leaving the people stranded. The bus, which was said to have taken off at Offa Garage motor park in Ilorin, was heading to Osogbo, Osun State when it burst into flames around 10:50 am. Eyewitness account said that the passengers were hurriedly evacuated from the bus, while their belongings and luggage were completely burnt in the inferno. The state sector commander of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Jonathan Owoade, who confirmed the incident, said “the FRSC had to stop oncoming vehicles for several minutes because of the intensity of the fire. “The intensity of the fire was high, the FRSC team stopped the movement of vehicles till the fire subsided. The team controlled the traffic afterwards and there is free movement of vehicles thereafter,” he said.
