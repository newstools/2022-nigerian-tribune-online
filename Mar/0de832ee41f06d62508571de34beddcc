The Deeper Life Bible Church Pastor in Okehi Local Government Area of Kogi State, Pastor Alimi Victor, has been hacked to death and his body dumped inside a pit by an unknown person. It was gathered that the deceased was said to be on his way home from a church service at Okaito area along Kabba-Okene road in Kogi, when his assailants struck. According to source, the death of the pastor may not be unconnected with issues arising from a grant scheme that he allegedly got himself involved in. The handlers of the scheme were said not have disbursed the grant to the beneficiaries. However, three suspects have been arrested in connection with the murder of the pastor, which occurred on March 10. The Police Public Relation Officer (PPRO), SP Williams Aya, who confirmed the killing said that the body of the deceased was found in a pit along the route of his church, few days after he was declared missing. He added that the command went after the suspects, and that intelligence has led to the arrest of three suspects. According to him, the three suspects are already undergoing interrogation at the Criminal Investigation Department (CID). He added that the command would not disclose the identities of the suspects now as the police were still making efforts to track more persons.
