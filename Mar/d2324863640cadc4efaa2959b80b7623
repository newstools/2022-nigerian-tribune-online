Nigeria’s electoral umpire, Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), must conduct the 2023 general elections according to the rules and constitution of the country. The electoral body must not engage in any act that will lead to anarchy. The 2023elections must be fair, free credible and transparent to eschew anarchy and any unnecessary constitutional crisis. Democrats and patriots in Nigeria implores INEC and its officials to let the votes of Nigerians count in 2023 as this will determine the continuous existence of our country. The coming elections must follow all the rules as this is the only panacea to the peace and stability of our country. Where there is no fair play and justice, certainly there will be no peace. lNEC should beware  of the antics of politicians who might want to play dirty games or bamboozle the electoral umpire to tamper with the wishes of the citizens. INEC should make the 2023 general elections very transparent by transmitting the results electronically to its Abuja platform for every Nigerian to see. The results must never be tampered or toyed with. This will surely remove any apathy in our electoral system.,Onitiri added.
