The Director-General of the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA), Dr Bashir Jamoh, has revealed that following the successes recorded by Nigeria in criminalising piracy and sea crimes through the Suppression of Piracy and Other Maritime Offences (SPOMO) Act, other West African countries located along the Gulf of Guinea (GoG) are now using the Act as a model in their Admiralty matters. Speaking recently during the second Nigerian Admiralty Law Colloquium, hosted by NIMASA in collaboration with the Nigeria Institute of Advanced Legal Studies (NIALS), the NIMASA DG stated that victories in the courts have rippled across Nigerian waters and helped reduce piracy to a 27-year low. “The theme this year is ‘Maritime Safety, Security and Shipping Development.’ Reflections and the way forward is born out of the need to reflect on the sector over the past five to ten years, analyse our challenges, praise our achievements and draw a road map on the way forward. IN CASE YOU MISSED THESE FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE “On maritime security, in 2019 The Suppression of Piracy and other Maritime Offences (SPOMO) Act came into law. This Act provides the legal teeth for the war against piracy in the Nigerian maritime environment. “The further zeal to keep our maritime space secured, promote socio-economic development and leaving no stone unturned, led to the launch of the Integrated National Security and Waterways Protection Infrastructure popularly referred to as the Deep Blue Project. “I am delighted to inform you that these interventions by the Agency are being recognised. Even the respected International Maritime Bureau (IMB) has acknowledged our efforts and commended Nigerias progress in her quest for security in the Gulf of Guinea in its reports,” Dr Jamoh said.
