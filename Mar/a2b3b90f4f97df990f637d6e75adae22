A media group, Auxilia Media, has highlighted the need to revive and imbibe family values, as well as create a bond between family members to curb societal ills in Nigeria and the African continent. This is even as family values will be the focal point of a new television game show tagged: “Family Fame,” which is set to hit major Nigeria television stations. At the unveiling of the pre-recorded family show, the Chief Executive Officer, Auxilia Media, Olufunke Fajusigbe, said the Family Fame show was a display of the media group’s commitment to ensuring that Nigerians are afforded the opportunities to enjoy the best content in family unity. She further said the show, to be aired weekly, was tailored fit for Nigerian households and designed to promote family unity, adding “This is one of many to start a long-lasting, all-year-long family entertainment.” According to her, “What makes a Nigerian family unique is the value. Everything is pulling families away and we feel that we need to do something to ensure the family is brought back together. Anything that will bring the families together will be a good venture economically and.mentally.” The Family Game Show, which is a 52- week long reality show with comedy, entertainment and other features, will feature two families weekly, composing of five members each, going head to head to guess the most popular responses to a series of survey questions answered by the people.

It’s not going to be swallowed up by other reality shows. We have got that space to showcase what we do. It’s very relaxing.” The Family Fame Show, which is scheduled to air on African Magic on Sundays at 6:30pm and Wazobia TV on Saturdays at 7:30pm, is anchored by one of Nigeria’s foremost comedians, Seyi Lawrence known as Seyi Law.
