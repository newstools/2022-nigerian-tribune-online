There was no member of the coaching crew that came to address the press as the Black Stars of Ghana on Tuesday at the Moshood Abiola Stadium, Abuja picked one of the five African tickets to Qatar after holding the Super Eagles of Nigeria to a 1-1 scoreline. The Ghanaians drew the first blood in the 10th minute through their captain, Thomas Partey, after a direct shot that hit Francis Uzoho in goal for Nigeria. The Eagles however restored parity in the 22nd minute through Williams Troost-Ekong after the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) awarded Nigeria a penalty after a thorough check. Tunisian referee, Sagol Selmi, cancelled what could have been Nigeria’s second goal after Osimhen was adjudged to be offside after another VAR check. The Ghanaians however held their nerve until the last minute and booked their fourth appearance in the World Cup However, irate fans went berserk following the draw and invaded the pitch after the final whistle but had to be subdued by the security men on the ground who dispersed them through tear gas. At the time of filing this report, none of the coaching crew came to brief the press for the post-match interview.  ORITAMEFA BAPTIST MODEL SCHOOLS, (OBMS), IBADAN
