At a historic groundbreaking ceremony, Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu joined US Ambassador Mary Beth Leonard and US Consul-General, Claire Pierangelo, on Thursday to officially mark the beginning of construction of the world’s largest US consulate in Lagos. Located on a 12.2-acre site in the rapidly developing Eko Atlantic City, the new US Consulate General in Lagos will support diplomatic and commercial relations between the United States and Nigeria and will provide American and Nigerian Consulate employees with a safe, secure, sustainable, and modern workplace. According to a statement by the US Embassy in Nigeria, the $537 million new world’s largest US consulate construction project will directly benefit the Nigerian people. “Throughout the project, an estimated $95 million will be invested in the local economy, and the project will employ approximately 2,500 Nigerian citizens, including engineers, architects, artisans, construction workers, and administrative staff. “These workers will have the opportunity to learn new technical skills and safety awareness that will help distinguish them in the local market.” In her remarks at the ceremony, Ambassador Mary Beth Leonard expressed appreciation to the Government of Nigeria and the Lagos State Government for their support. “Our vision for this remarkable Consulate campus is to create a facility that both honours the vibrant relationship between the United States and Nigeria and communicates the spirit of American democracy, transparency and openness,” Ambassador Leonard said. “Nigeria and the United States have a long-standing history of people-to-people engagement fostering bridges between our two nations. We look forward to the many accomplishments we will continue to achieve together in the future,” Consul General Claire Pierangelo said.
