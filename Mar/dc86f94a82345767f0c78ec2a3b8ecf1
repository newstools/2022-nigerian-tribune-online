It will also provide a platform for Nigerians, particularly the youth, to discover their potentials and flourish in them. Speaking about the inspiration behind it, the secretary of the organization, Mr Martin Anuhilu, said “De Seeker intends to portray an all-encompassing reality show in which people from all walks of life can actively engage, with viewing not limited to persons of a certain age, sex, or socio-economic standing. We came up with this initiative to discover and develop new talents for the entertainment space and most importantly give them a platform to flourish. “The flag off show which will be unveiling the reality show is just going to be a tip of the entertainment you should expect from the Reality show as I promise that you will be entertained to the fullest. We are very optimistic that this will go a long way to solve the leadership problem we have in Africa which will in turn solve the problem of unemployment and poverty in Africa.” ORITAMEFA BAPTIST MODEL SCHOOLS, (OBMS), IBADAN
