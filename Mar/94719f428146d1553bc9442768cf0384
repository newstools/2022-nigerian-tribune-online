Soldiers from the 3 Battalion of the Nigerian Army, Effurun-Warri are combing the streets of Warri, the commercial nerve centre of Delta State, for killers of an Operation Officer. Our correspondent gathered on Tuesday that the unnamed officer was hacked to death in the late hours of Friday, March 11, 2022, at popular Enerhen Road by yet-to-be-identified gunmen. Reports have it that military authorities have since launched a manhunt for those involved in the murder across the twin-town of Effurun and Warri. As of the time of filing the report, the army authorities are yet to issue any statement on the murder. A terse WhatsApp message from the security intelligence unit of an unnamed organisation has warned its staff to “exercise extra security precautions and vigilance, particularly within Enerhen and environs.” The statement read thus: “Information reaching our Security Intelligence Unit reveals that the Operations Officer of 3 Battalion Warri was gruesomely murdered by yet to be identified gunmen in the late hours of Friday, Mar 11, 2022, at Enerhen Road. IN CASE YOU MISSED THESE FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE “As a result, the military authorities have launched a manhunt for the culprits involved in the murder. “In view of the above, staff are kindly advised on the need to exercise extra security precautions and vigilance, particularly within Enerhen and environs. “We are strongly advised to avoid late-night movements around these troubled areas and Warri in general. “The Security Team will continue to monitor this situation and provide the necessary updates as required. Stay Safe! Regards.” Meanwhile, when contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Delta Police Command, DSP Bright Edafe, said he was yet to be informed of the incident.
