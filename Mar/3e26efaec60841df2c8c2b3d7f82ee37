Last time we began looking at the issue of teams, working in partnership with others. Life is not designed for us to live in isolation. “There is no such thing as a self-made man. You will reach your goals only with the help of others.” George Shinn We need people and people need us and this is especially critical in leadership. Effective leadership always involves the operation of an effective team. A team is a number of people associated in a joint venture working harmoniously towards the corporate good by the individual contribution of their specialized input. We also saw the characteristics of an effective team. Today we continue. “Teamwork is the ability to work together toward a common vision. The ability to direct individual accomplishments toward organizational objectives. It is the fuel that allows common people to attain uncommon results.” Andrew Carnegie The leader is a very critical factor in the successful operation of any team. “Ultimately, leadership is not about glorious crowning acts. It’s about keeping your team focused on a goal and motivated to do their best to achieve it, especially when the stakes are high and the consequences really matter. It is about laying the groundwork for others’ success, and then standing back and letting them shine.” Chris Hadfield “Remember, teamwork begins by building trust. And the only way to do that is to overcome our need for invulnerability.”Patrick Lencioni Teams, if well run, will produce a multiplier effect on the output of the team hence teams are needed in virtually every sector of life. Next time we will look at some areas where teams are needed. TO BE CONTINUED FOR ENQUIRIES AND COMMENTS PLEASE SEND EMAIL TO charismokola@yahoo.com ORITAMEFA BAPTIST MODEL SCHOOLS, (OBMS), IBADAN
