Oni Victor Samuel popularly known as NARLTI in this interview with NMN_NETWORK revealed the story behind his passion for music. WHAT IS THE STORY BEHIND YOUR STAGE NAME? I would say it’s a long story but I’ll go straight to the point, initially it was Vikkynaughty in my secondary school days. My friends called me that but eventually I decided to spice it up to a name not usual and I arrived at Narlti . WHERE ARE YOU FROM ? I grew up in Ibadan but my Dad is a native of gbongan, Osun State and my mom hails from ibadan. And she’s cold too. You can say I’m from Osun State. WHAT FIRST GOT YOU INTO MUSIC? I grew up around music, not hip hop or the modern day music but Christian story telling music, my father loves them and he was always listening to these songs on loud stereos every Saturday morning, eventually I started developing interest in music but I never wanted to make those kind of songs, eventually I started listening to rap at age 10 and I knew that was the kind of music I wanted to make and the rest is history WHO INSPIRED YOU TO MAKE MUSIC? I had been inspired by those Saturday morning songs but not until I started listening to Wayne and Meek that I made up my mind I could do this shit for real HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE THE MUSIC THAT YOU TYPICALLY CREATE? I create any kind of music, it depends on what I hear from the beats, I’m real typical when it comes to beats, I create from it. Unfortunately can’t make one WHAT IS YOUR CREATIVE PROCESS LIKE? When I listen to beats, I take my time to digest every part of it, if it’s the type I can work with, I’ll make sure I play around with it, treat it like my baby, get my hook then the verses can come in WHO WOULD YOU MOST LIKE TO COLLABORATE WITH? Vory, he’s signed to meek mill, that boy different IF YOU COULD GO OPEN A SHOW FOR ANY ARTIST WHO WOULD IT BE? Big Wiz WHAT DOES YOUR ART MEAN TO YOU? It means Life to me, it’s what I live for and I enjoy it while I do it WHAT DO YOU FEEL IS THE BEST SONG YOU’VE RELEASED AND WHY? I don’t think I personally have a favorite, all my joints are fire HOW MANY TRACKS,EP , ALBUM HAVE YOU MADE SO FAR ? 7 singles 1 Ep HOW DO YOU MAKE IT? There’s no special way around it, all you need is allow the beat connect with your soul, put you in the mood and you’re good IF YOU CAN HAVE YOUR FAN’S REMEMBER ONE THING ABOUT YOU WHAT WOULD IT BE? These sweet music won’t stop anytime soon WHAT IS THE MOST USELESS TALENT YOU HAVE? Staying indoors, I could stay indoors for weeks, I care a lot about my space DO YOU SING IN THE SHOWER? WHAT SONGS? Yes I do! Any song that pops out of my head WHAT WOULD YOU BE DOING RIGHT NOW, IF IT WASN’T FOR YOUR MUSIC CAREER? I’d be a stylist, I’m heavy on fashion WHERE DO YOU FIND INSPIRATION? I get inspiration from my ambience, people around me, whatever I’m going through at that moment I’m penning those words down. It could be anything, it goes with the mood WHERE HAVE YOU PERFORMED? WHAT ARE YOUR FAVOURITE AND LEAST FAVOURITE VENUES? DO YOU HAVE ANY UPCOMING SHOWS? I’ve opened for Kida Kudz at his homecoming concert at Ibadan in December, i opened for Bella Shmurda the following day in ibadan and I’ve performed at a couple of shows in my school and recently I just performed in Lagos for the first time alongside my music twin Skongz…. For now I’m not booked HOW DO YOU FEEL THE INTERNET HAS IMPACTED THE MUSIC BUSINESS? The internet has really helped the music scene, it allows artists and audience communication with the help of various platforms and it creates various platforms for your music to be heard, you can distribute to people far and wide from wherever your location is, you get to engage with your musical audience. It also allows the platform for creativity with your music. WHAT IS YOUR FAVOURITE SONG TO PERFORM? I have a few of them but lately David Beckham,100 to the Feds and Plain Jane have been giving Moshpit vibes WHICH FAMOUS MUSICIANS DO YOU ADMIRE? Kanye West, Wizkid, Meek Mill, Sza, 6lack, Rick Ross, Vory ,Tory Lanez, Central Cee and Dutchavelli  IF YOU COULD DATE ANY OTHER MUSICIAN (CELEBRITY), WHO WOULD IT BE Lol we have so many beautiful female celebrities and I’m definitely crushing on a few WHAT IS THE MOST TROUBLE YOU’VE EVER GOTTEN INTO? Got expelled from school, it was a crazy experience, I had to move away from home cause my dad couldn’t stand the sight of seeing me around knowing other kids were in school, I stayed with some family friends for a while before I got back on my feet. Crazy times WHAT IS THE BEST ADVICE YOU’VE BEEN GIVEN? I can do anything as long as I put my mind to it. IF YOU COULD CHANGE ANYTHING ABOUT THE INDUSTRY, WHAT WOULD IT BE? I wish every creative could just get his/her flowers rightfully. Credit where credit’s due. Not that hard TELL ME ABOUT YOUR BEST PERFORMANCE?
