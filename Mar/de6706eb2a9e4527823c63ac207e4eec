I want to know if the face mask is still necessary with the reduction in the incidence of COVID 19 all over the world. Nkechi (by SMS)  Even though there is a slight reduction in cases of COVID 19, it is still important to use the facemask. This is because it has been confirmed that face masks do help control the spread of COVID-19. These masks can block viral droplets emitted when the mask wearer speaks, coughs, sneezes or exhales. Experts recommend that masks be worn by everyone to prevent the spread of COVID-19 by people who are infected but don’t realise it (since it’s estimated that there are many asymptomatic or presymptomatic COVID-19 cases). It is most important to wear a face mask in public settings when around people outside of your household, especially when you’re indoors or in places where it’s difficult to stay away from others. Be sure that your face mask covers both your mouth and nose, and don’t touch your face mask while wearing it. ORITAMEFA BAPTIST MODEL SCHOOLS, (OBMS), IBADAN
