Gunmen suspected to be bandits have reportedly kidnapped 46 people in Agunu Dutse, Agunu Ward of Kachia Local Government Area of Kaduna State. A resident of the area, Maurice Clement Tanko, told Tribune Online that the gunmen came to the area around 12:30 a.m. on Thursday when people were fast asleep. “It was around 12:30 a.m. that our volunteer vigilante noticed some unusual movements in the area,” he said. According to him, the vigilante then flashed their torchlight to know whether they are their colleagues, “but when the invaders did not flash back, they knew instantly that they were intruders. “We began to hear the wailings of people as the bandits moved frome one house and the other. “In fact, the gunmen operated for about 20 minutes before taking away about 46 people into the forest. The number could have been more but they noticed that the vigilante were regrouping.” Another member of the community, Abubakar Sule, was reported to have been injured during the attack, but he is presently receiving treatment in a medical facility. The state police command and the state government are yet to react to the incident as of the time of filing the report.  ORITAMEFA BAPTIST MODEL SCHOOLS, (OBMS), IBADAN
