MR Adeolu Ogunbanjo, Chairman of National Association of Telecommunications Subscribers (NATCOMS), has once again said  there are no health hazards associated with erecting telecoms masts in residential areas. Ogunbanjo in a chat in Lagos last week said Electro Magnetic Frequency (EMF) from telecoms masts was not harmful to humans around the mast. He stated that the World Health Organistion (WHO) in 2007 had conducted several researches and concluded that masts erected in residential areas had any negative effect on the health of humans and animals. Ogunbanjo further called for an increase in the number of telecoms masts in the country to enhance the quality of telecommunication networks. “Everywhere in the world, masts must be erected and WHO said the emissions from the mast is not enough to cause any damage and since 2007 there has been no issues. “The telecoms industry should provide more masts so that the quality of service will be improved for the subscribers to enjoy better services. “According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), the low intensity of cell site emissions is estimated to be between 0.002 per cent and 2 per cent of the levels of safe exposure, and is lower than those produced by a radio or TV transmission,” the Chairman said.
