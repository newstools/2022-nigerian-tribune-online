Suspected arms-wielding herdsmen have reportedly abducted a former chairman of the Federated Chapel of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), Bayelsa State Council, Comrade Julius Osahon and others. They were abducted late Monday, March 28, along the East-West road, by Ewreni community, in Ughelli North Local Government Area of Delta State. Osahon, who hails from Edo State, is the Guardian correspondent in Bayelsa State. It was gathered that the gunmen also shot dead a driver working with Sunny Eru Motors, abducting the journalist and about 17 passengers. The gunmen have reportedly established contact with the journalist’s wife, demanding five million naira ransom for his release. A Warri-based lawyer, Mr. Lucky Egboyi Esq, who said he escaped the scene by the whiskers, told journalists in Warri that they were returning from Bayelsa State when they ran into the herdsmen operating in the road. He disclosed that the suspected herdsmen shot the Sunny Eru driver in the head and kidnapped several passengers. “It was a narrow escape for me and a few others because we had to run into the bush. The policemen who came ran away with their van,” he claimed. The Delta State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Bright Edafe said he wasn’t aware of the incident yet.
