Police in Agbor, Delta State have arrested Blessing Ndidi, a housewife, for attempting to cut off her husband’s manhood over allegation of infidelity at Alisemien community in Ika South Local Government Area of the state. Nigerian Tribune gathered that Ndidi, a native of Akokwa in Imo State had on several occasions inflicted injuries on her husband. On the fateful night, it was further gathered that the man, a bricklayer was said to have been drunk before the attack. After the attack, he was later rushed to a private hospital in Boji Boji Owa in Ika North East Local Government Area where he is recuperating. IN CASE YOU MISSED THESE FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE  The report said that the couple had been married for about three years without children even as the wife had been accusing the husband of infidelity. It was alleged that the woman had in the past attacked the man with a pestle and knives at any provocation, warning to chop off the husband’s manhood if she ever discovers that he has a child with another woman. Confirming the story on Thursday, the state Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Bright Edafe, said the victim was not helping in the investigation as he insisted that charges should not be preffered against her “because she is my wife.” ORITAMEFA BAPTIST MODEL SCHOOLS, (OBMS), IBADAN
