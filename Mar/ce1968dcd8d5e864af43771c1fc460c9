THE Director-General of NYSC, Major General Shuaibu Ibrahim has warned that the Scheme will henceforth prosecute Nigerian graduates who refuse to present themselves for mobilisation for National Service after completion of their studies. This was even as the scheme denied claims that a corps member was shot dead by Policemen in Ibadan while returning with his car from the weekly Community Development Service within the metropolis. The DG spoke at the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding between the NYSC and the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) for the prosecution of its criminal cases. According to him, section 13 Sub Section 1(a) and (b) empowers the Service Corps to prosecute offenders, who refused to present themselves for national service. General Ibrahim who was represented by the Director, Legal Services of the Scheme, Barrister Tijjani Ahmed Ibrahim, disclosed that NYSC has been having challenges in prosecuting some of its cases and expressed confidence that the partnership with the NSCDC would bring this to an end. He assured that the Scheme would live up to its responsibilities as stipulated in the MOU. The NYSC helmsman commended the NSCDC for its steadfast support to the Scheme recalling that it was the Corps which spearheaded the discovery and dismantling of a fake NYSC Camp as well as the successful prosecution of the culprits. In his speech at the event which took place at the NSCDC headquarters in Abuja, the Commandant General of the Corps, Dr. Ahmed Abubakar Audi assured the NYSC of the readiness of his organisation to assist the Scheme in the pursuit of its mandate. Represented by the Director Legal Services of the Corps, Umar Aliyu Mohammed, the Commandant further promised to ensure that the partnership yields the desired objectives. Meanwhile, the Scheme said no corps member was shot in the head or chest and no life was lost during the encounter beteen some corps members and policemen on duty. “The attention of the management of NYSC has been drawn to the news making rounds in the social media that a corps member was shot dead by policemen at Ibadan while returning with his car from the weekly Community Development Service within the Ibadan metropolis. “As a matter of fact, the police authorities in Oyo State quickly intervened and the situation was immediately brought under control, and normalcy returned as expected,” she said. It said the Commissioner of Police in Oyo State has authorised an investigation into the matter to ensure that those who erred are reprimanded accordingly.
