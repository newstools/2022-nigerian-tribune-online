The Orthodox Anglican Communion (Nigeria) has created two provinces and two additional dioceses which include the Diocese of Ibadan and Diocese of Ekiti, in addition to the existing ones as part of its activities to expand the church. Tribune Church News gathered that the two provinces were established at a three-day Episcopal Synod, held recently at The Cathedral Church of Emmanuel, Obosi, Anambra State, under the Diocese of Onitsha. The Synod also featured the election of Archbishops of the church, which include the Most Reverend (Dr) Chidi Chukelu for Province of Eastern Nigeria, and the Most Reverend Sunday Ojo (JP) for the Province of Western Nigeria. The church authority also elected Very Reverend Emmanuel Bolarinwa as the Bishop-elect for the Diocese of Ibadan and Very Reverend Emmanuel Falade as the Bishop-elect for the Diocese of Ekiti. The highpoint of the event was the presentation of certificates of Incorporation issued by the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) and the presentation of the Patent Certificate by the Federal Ministry of Industry, Trade, and Investment through Very Reverend Bolarinwa to the church authority. According to Archbishop Chikelu of Eastern province, the new development was a welcomed one and would stir the expansion of the church, which will contribute to the universal growth of the church. The Archbishop of Western Province, the Most Reverend Ojo (JP) on behalf of other bishops at the Episcopal synod expressed joy and thanked God for a successful registration, creation of two provinces, creation of two additional dioceses, the election of archbishops and bishops.
