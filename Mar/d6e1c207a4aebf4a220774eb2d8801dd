It would be an understatement to imply that the Nigerian government has failed in its primary responsibility of protecting the lives of its citizens. Under any form, this catastrophe is cruel, inhumane, insensitive, and repugnant. The only solution is to take decisive action by tracking these terrorists attacking and kidnapping travelers to their hideouts. It is inexcusable to wait for them to attack before confronting them. They only deserve death by any means necessary. The terrorists have declared total war on the country and undoubtedly put our territorial integrity and sovereignty to the test. Thus, allowing them to experience the freedom of fresh air is unacceptable. Sadly, you only see government action promptly when their party is in crisis, or some forces are threatening their power. Surveillance can only work when these unrepentant bandits are followed to their hideout and eliminated. Our gallant security operatives should sustain an offensive. My thoughts and prayers are with the victims who are being attacked innocuously daily, while the government’s apparent incompetence keeps reassuring citizens just on paper, with no hope in sight. I, therefore, call on the government to rise to its responsibility.  Tajuddeen Ahmad Tijjani, Bauchi State. ORITAMEFA BAPTIST MODEL SCHOOLS, (OBMS), IBADAN
