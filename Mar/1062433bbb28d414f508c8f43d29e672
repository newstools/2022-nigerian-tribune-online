Rotimi Raimi-Hassan, Port General Manager of KIDP, who recently completed a round of business visits to 30 companies including Kaduna Refinery and Petrochemical Company (KRPC), Dangote Peugeot Automobiles and Kaduna Chamber of Commerce Industries Mines and Agriculture (KADCCIMA), urged companies involved with importation in Kaduna and proximate areas like Abuja to take advantage of the seamless and professional cargo handling of KIDP by routing their importation through the dry port. He recalled the long standing business relationship between KIDP and KRPC over the years and reassured that KIDP would help in time and cost saving for import and export through its facility.
