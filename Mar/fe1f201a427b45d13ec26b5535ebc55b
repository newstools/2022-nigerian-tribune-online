A new reality show, ‘De Seeker’ created to exhibit the talents of Nigerians is set to debut with an opening show tomorrow. The event, which aims to showcase various creatives and talents, will kick off with a spectacular event at the Beetles Xtra Lounge in Awka, featuring top music performances by Humblesmith, Kcee, Slow Dog, Mr Raw, and comedy by Apama, Prophet Rolex, Unku Sp, Lord Zeus, Diamond Okechi, among others. According to the organisers, the goal of the reality show is to identify, develop and market talents, gifts or potentials. It will also provide a platform for Nigerians, particularly the youth, to discover their potentials and flourish in them. Speaking about the inspiration behind the show, the secretary of the organisation, Mr Martin Anuhilu said, “De Seeker intends to portray an all-encompassing reality show in which people from all walks of life can actively engage, with viewing not limited to persons of a certain age, sex, or socioeconomic standing. We came up with this initiative to discover and develop new talents for the entertainment space and most importantly give them a platform to flourish. “The flag off show, which will be unveiling the reality show, is just going to be a tip of the entertainment you should expect from the reality show as I promise that you will be entertained to the fullest. We are very optimistic that this will go a long way to solve the leadership problem we have in Africa which will in turn solve the problem of unemployment and poverty in Africa. Finally, I will like to use this medium to implore all talented youths to please not let this lifetime opportunity pass them by as it will be a game changer for the winner” ORITAMEFA BAPTIST MODEL SCHOOLS, (OBMS), IBADAN
