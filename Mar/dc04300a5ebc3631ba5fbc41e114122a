Former Kano State Governor, Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, has dumped the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). It will be recalled that Senator Kwankwaso, recently had said he will defect from the party to a new party, the New Nigeria People Party (NNPP). Kwankwaso resigned his membership from PDP in a letter he sent to his ward chairman on Tuesday, dated March 29, 2022. This is coming hours after a court stopped PDP from dissolving Kano executives of the party.  ORITAMEFA BAPTIST MODEL SCHOOLS, (OBMS), IBADAN
