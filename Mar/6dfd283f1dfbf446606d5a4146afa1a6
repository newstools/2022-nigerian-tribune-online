Disturbed by the plan of former Gombe State governor, Senator Danjuma Goje to dump the All Progressives Congress (APC), a chieftain of the party, Bola Tinubu; Kano State Governor, Dr Abdullahi Ganduje; a former governor of Borno State, Senator Kashim Shettima and notable party members allegedly stormed Goje’s residence in Asokoro, Abuja, on Saturday night. This was coming barely two days after the immediate-past Governor of Gombe State, Ibrahim Hassan Dankwambo and other Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chieftains including Rivers State governor, Nyesom Wike; former Ekiti State governor, Ayodele Fayose; Senate deputy minority leader, Senator Philips Aduda and a former member of the House of Representatives, who represented Billiri/Balanga federal constituency, Hon. Ali Isa JC visited Goje to woo him to join the PDP. IN CASE YOU MISSED THESE FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE  According to a source, the APC leaders’ visit to Goje may not be unconnected with the earlier visit of the PDP leaders, who were at Goje’s residence to ostensibly woo him back to their party which he left in 2014. It will also be recalled that the former Minister of Power is having a running battle with the governor, Inuwa Yahaya and with the lingering crisis in APC, he may eventually return to the PDP. The visit held last Saturday night was said to have lasted for hours but as at the time of filing this report, it was not certain whether they arrived at a positive outcome.
