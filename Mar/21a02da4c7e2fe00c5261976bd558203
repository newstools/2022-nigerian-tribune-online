Who will help us to put an end to insecurity in Nigeria? We need to continue to speak up and express our grievances to the Federal Government of Nigeria; they cannot continue to gloss over the security challenges facing the average Nigerian. We are tired of sending condolences to family members of victims of insecurity. It is the duty of the Federal Government to ensure the protection of lives and property; lives are being lost daily. Enough is enough. Across all geopolitical zones, bandits, kidnappers and ritualists have taken over and the government is looking on while they have a field day. This is the right time for all Nigerians both home and abroad to speak up. I want to make a passionate appeal to President Muhammadu Buhari and Engr. Seyi Makinde to change their strategies by putting necessary machinery in place to protect our lives and property. We are all living in a state of fear. Nobody is safe in Nigeria except those in power. Once again, let’s all speak up now against insecurity in Nigeria. If it requires us to come out to protest against insecurity, let’s all come out.
