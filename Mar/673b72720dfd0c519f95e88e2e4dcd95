The United States Justice Department has described as untrue, reports that Ramon Olorunwa Abbas, also known as Hushpuppi, committed $400,000 fraud inside a prison in the United States. Some media outfits on Thursday reported that some “US state prosecutors submitted documents” which showed that he committed fraud and laundered over $400,000 while in jail in the United States. According to them, the documents submitted before the United States District Court of California on Wednesday revealed that Hushpuppi committed fraud and money laundering while in a US federal correctional facility as he was said to have participated in the purchase and laundering of Economic Impact Payment debit cards fraudulently obtained from stolen data of US citizens and residents. However, the US Department of Justice, while reacting to the viral news reports, described them as untrue as there was no information to that effect. Speaking with the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) on Thursday, Mrozek Thom, Director of Media Relations, United States Attorney General Office, disclosed that the reports are untrue. According to him: “After whe have looked at the documents that were reported by the media, the US Attorney Office in Los Angeles which filed a suit against Mr Abass did not file any such documents. “We have checked with the FBI agent that was reported to have written the documents and he confirmed to us that he knew nothing about the documents, saying they were fake.” ORITAMEFA BAPTIST MODEL SCHOOLS, (OBMS), IBADAN
