There is a need to actively engage youths and ensure their representation in governance, leadership, and entrepreneurship development in Nigeria because this is the only way the nation can enjoy true and sustainable development. Youths are the future of every nation and this is not a cliché, the abilities of the upcoming generation will determine the kind of future the nation will have. The youths are the greatest assets any nation can boast of and if they are not carried along, the nation is merely creating a background for a bleak future. If adequately mentored and supported, Nigeria’s young population can unlock an era of technology-driven economic rebirth, social transformation, and sustainable development in key sectors. It is therefore important for the ruling class to understand the importance of youths not as political thugs or errand boys but as key contributors to the policy of the nation. Every barrier blocking youths from attaining their potentials and participating in governance and leadership must be demolished by the conscious efforts of every Nigerian. Our political class must realise that the future belongs to the youths and must allow them have a voice to prepare for the future. The important roles of young people in building a vibrant and healthy nation cannot be overemphasised and youths must rise up to take a stand and become the voice and conscience of the society.
