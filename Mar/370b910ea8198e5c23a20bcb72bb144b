I want to say congratulation to the newly crowned Olubadan of Ibadan, Oba Senator Lekan  Balogun and I pray that the Almighty Allah will preserve the life of Kabiyesi for us in Ibadan. Our new king is well educated and he is also vibrant; and I entertain no fear that he is worthy of the office. There are many issues to be resolved by the new Olubadan and I plead that he looks into those issues. A major issue is the prevalent land grabbing in Ibadan which has taken dangerous dimensions. I also want to bring the issue of insecurity in Ibadan to the attention of our Oba. He should also prevail on rich Ibadan indigenes to help the children of the less privileged people in the society and encourage those in the Diaspora to come home and invest to develop the historic city of Ibadan  Barrister Jimoh Mumin, Ibadan.
