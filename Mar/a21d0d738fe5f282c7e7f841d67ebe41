The All Progressives Congress Caretaker/ Extraodinary Convention Planning Committee under the leadership of Niger State governor, Abubakar Sani Bello, is set for a showdown with the Independent National Electoral Commission over the latter’s request for a 21-day fresh notice for conduct of a national convention. Speaking with newsmen at a press briefing on Friday, a chieftain of the party, Mr Ismaeel Ahmed, dismissed INEC stance as he accused the electoral body of misinterpretation of the Electoral Act 2022. Ahmed said INEC could not ask for a fresh notice but simply a notice of an adjustment and not a fresh 21-day notice. Ahmed claimed that INEC had earlier been informed by APC of its intention to convene its national convention in February 26,2022. Details later… ORITAMEFA BAPTIST MODEL SCHOOLS, (OBMS), IBADAN
