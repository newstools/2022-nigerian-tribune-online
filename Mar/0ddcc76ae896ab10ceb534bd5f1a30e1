The following Nigerian literature has already been exposed to a range of critical readings as is customary. While we shouldn’t be unaware of the present arguments about the novelists’ categorization or lack thereof, it is self-evident that these books are, whichever their categorization – third-generation artists are receiving comparable crucial treatment tactics. Critics have debated the roots of this tradition, focusing on specific writers as well as the evolving canon as a whole. The new breed of Nigerians, on the other hand, has clearly mastered their craft, they’ve kept on creating remarkable diagonal and longitudinal rates of development in terms of contemporary culture, with newer names surfacing almost regularly.

This notion that the new authors have been reflecting post-independence countries’ goals continues to drive critics to step in. Not all Nigerian playwrights share identical interests, they all share similar lyrical problems and objectives. To put that another way, everyone in African literature has an ethical thread running through it. In its most basic form, this connection is an unwavering dedication to political and social challenges, which, according to Mutisso (1974), adds up to “governance in publications being just a nutritionally dense pattern seeing as satisfactory news outlets in given Africa aspire to extrapolate the society-wide systems that will be passed down across the decades’ friendships”. As a consequence, new Nigerian intellectuals are willing to set aside the tough realities of the enabling environment for a little while.
