The convener of national prayer conference, Apostle Edith Grace, has said that there is hope for Nigeria, despite her challenges. She gave this charge while speaking at the March 2022 edition of the conference with the theme ‘Forsaking the vices Plaguing Nigeria’ held at Oriental Hotel, Victoria Island, Lagos. She also expressed sadness over the happenings in Nigeria, but said she believed there is hope for the nation if Nigerians could intercede for her, stressing that God is counting on Nigerians for a positive turnaround in the nation. “I feel like crying because of the things happening in this nation. God is counting on us (Nigerians) to intercede for our nation. I believe God is doing a new thing in Nigeria. The purpose of our gathering is to intercede for our great nation, Nigeria,” she said. The apostle enjoined Nigerians to be proud of their country despite her challenges, saying they have no other country as their home. She also advised Nigerians to stop saying bad things about the country, pointing to the colours of Nigeria’s national flag that stand for fruitfulness, purity and peace. “So, why do you want to give up on this nation? Why do you keep saying bad things about this nation? This conference is a great spiritual meeting. Whatever is going to happen in 2023 elections in this nation, we are going to decide it now,” she added. Apart from the powerful prayer declarations over the affairs of Nigeria by some anointed men and women of God at the conference, the major speakers at the meeting on various situations in Nigeria were Prophet Eja Ndifon, Apostle James Okocha, Bishop Ugo Wems, Dr. Christian Nwanne, Bishop Oscar Ossai and Dr. Richard Bolaji.
