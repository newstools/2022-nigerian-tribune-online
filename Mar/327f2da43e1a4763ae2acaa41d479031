Why should Nigeria which produces crude oil be exporting crude and importing refined petroleum products and Nigerians continue to suffer under the weight of fuel scarcity? How long will it take the Federal Government to stop ASUU from going on strike? Why is it difficult for the Federal Government to give us regular electricity? President Muhammadu Buhari has ministers and special advisers who are working for him; he cannot see everything and this is why his aides are expected to update him about the reality of the humongous problems facing Nigerians. This is why competent hands must be put in charge of ministries. Presidernt Buhari needs to prove that he knows what is going on and has the capacity to put an end to this; he should not act like a spectator to the situation in Nigeria as a whole. Nigeria remains a blessed country with limitless resources; a country that has abundance of crude now has long queues at various petrol stations and Nigerians now spend long hours or pay exorbitant fees for fuel. Nigerians are going through pains and the president is aware except he is not in charge, or can he claim that he doesn’t know what is going on in the country? Businesses are dying, schools are under lock due to ASUU strike and prices of commodities are on  the rise. Indeed, many families cannot make ends meet again. This is not good and President Muhammadu Buhari needs to prove he is in charge and able. Also, his advisers should do their job. Jimoh Mumin, Ibadan  ORITAMEFA BAPTIST MODEL SCHOOLS, (OBMS), IBADAN
