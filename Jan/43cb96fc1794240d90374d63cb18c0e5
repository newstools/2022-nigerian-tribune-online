The Nigerian Baptist Convention (NBC) has lamented the death of former governor, Adebayo Alao-Akala, saying his death was a huge loss to the state, the Baptist family in Oyo State, Nigeria and Africa. A statement by the NBC on Tuesday said “the news of the death of the former governor came as a shock and devastation to the Nigerian Baptist Convention and the All African Baptist Fellowship families.” The statement, signed by Pastor Eben Durodola, the Public Relation Officer (PRO) of the convention, described Alao-Akala as “a humble, generous, caring, influential, God-fearing man and an administrator par excellence.” He added that “he lived a fulfilled relational life and achieved much in the areas of politics, charity, personal influence, missions, and helping others.” The Nigerian Baptist Convention said: “Late Chief Alao-Akala will be remembered for his doggedness and the zeal he exhibited toward the spread and expansion of the gospel of Jesus Christ, during his lifetime. “He assisted many people to rise in life and was well-loved by his people and Nigeria at large. “The Nigerian Baptist Convention will miss a great gem, philanthropist, and a very important personality. “The President of the Nigerian Baptist Convention and the entire Baptist family in Africa do commiserate with the Oyo State governor, Seyi Makinde; people of Ogbomoso, Oyo State, South/West Zone and the entire country and pray that God will console the family and everybody he left behind,” the release stated.  100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>Click Here Now! << How Adetunji Made Over N20million In 2021 From Football Trading.
