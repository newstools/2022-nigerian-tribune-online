There are rising paper-scholars taking charge of this age. It is fast becoming unbecoming to behold emerging eggheads who housed encyclopedia of papers within the confine of their brain but cannot proffer a simple practical solution to a seeming complexity ravaging the discipline whose paper knowledge dwell within them. Alas, this is a pre-failing and prevailing misery putting to jeopardy the true definition of knowledge. Millions of graduates of business administration, economics, entrepreneurship etc, go about quoting many scholars in their respective discipline but none of them have the intellectual capacity to propose a panacea to the economic impotency ravaging this country; many graduates of entrepreneurship development studies, and business administration and management with impressive grades in the school cannot successfully manage a business. Isn’t this sad? For how long do we need to be conscious of the fact that we need to invest more on practical-oriented activities which is quite germane and imperative than committing volumes of textbook to heart? None of us are yet to be a contemporary scholar if we can’t challenge the existing knowledge or add to it. Then, how do we add or challenge the existing knowledge if the potential dwelling from within us is to be the living encyclopedia of theories instead of contributing to the body of knowledge or challenge the existing ones constructively and practically?
