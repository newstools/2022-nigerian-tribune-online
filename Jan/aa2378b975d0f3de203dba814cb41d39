Kwara State area command of the Nigeria Customs Service says it has intercepted and seized a large cache of arms and ammunition worth over one million naira. Speaking with journalists in Ilorin on Wednesday, the Customs Area Controller, Comptroller Hussaini Bello Ahmed, who described the seizure as epic, said that the large quantity of ammunition was packaged in 25 packs of 25 rounds each, and contained in 14 cartons. The Customs boss, who said that a suspect was arrested in connection with the seizure, added that the seizure was made around the border community of Bukuro axis of the command in the Baruten local government area of Kwara state. “Based on intelligence report, the command intercepted a Peugeot 504 vehicle with registration number AP 448 AKD. On searching the vehicle, it was found to contain a large number of pump-action cartridges suspected to be smuggled into the country. Section 149 of Customs and excise Management Act (CEMA) of April 1958 Cap 45 LFN 2004 (as amended) gives Customs officers powers to search vehicles/ships.
