Those who have been following happenings on the entertainment scene would have observed that erstwhile friends and partners, Funke Akindele and Eniola Badmus are yet to quash their beef weeks after things fell apart between them. While some people fingered Akindele’s absence at Badmus’s 20 years on stage anniversary in December as the reason behind their rift, it was gathered that there seems to be more to the bad blood between them than meets the eye. Information gathered by R revealed that while Akindele stayed away from Badmus’s anniversary that attracted notable entertainers, she gave her a big shout-out on her Instagram page same day and wished her a happy birthday. R observed that their friendship has now gone from bad to worse as they are no longer on talking terms and have stopped hyping each other on social media platforms or sharing loved-up pictures like they used to do. While talks are said to be ongoing to reconcile them, neither Funke nor Badmus is willing to blink first as they have not been seen together since then.
