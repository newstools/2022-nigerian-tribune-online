An Ado-Ekiti Customary Court in Ado Ekiti State, has dissolved the 19-year-old marriage between a 72-year-old man, Adeniyi Adeyemi and his 52-year-old wife, Folasade. The marriage was dissolved on grounds of adultery, discontent, intransigence and fetish practices. The septuagenarian had earlier told the court that Folasade was stubborn, ill-tempered and adulterous. According to him, she was having an affair with an herbalist. Adeniyi told the court he confronted the herbalist and that he promised to stay clear of his wife but that he never did. Adeniyi further alleged that his wife went out at will without his consent and never showed any sign of remorse when he rebuked her. He prayed the court to dissolve their marriage and grant him custody of their two children. In her defence, Folasade denied the allegations leveled against her by her husband. She said Adeniyi’s other wife inflicted her and caused her hand to swell which was her reason for consulting the herbalist. She stated that her elder brother directed her to the herbalist, adding that there was no relationship between her and the man. She alleged that her husband was fond of cursing her and their children. She thus agreed that their marriage be dissolved. The court president, Mrs Olayinka Akomolede, observed that their marriage had broken down irretrievably and therefore dissolved it. Akomolede awarded custody of their female child to Folasade and ordered that their male child decide who between the two parents he would love to stay with. The court president also ordered Adeniyi to be responsible for the education of his children, and their daughter N10, 000 monthly as feeding allowance.
