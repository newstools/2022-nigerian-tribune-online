The Federal Government has ordered a massive security operation against ISWAP terrorists and armed bandits trying to make the Kainji National Park in Niger State their new operational base. The terrorists were said to be fleeing from some states and local governments in the North West and North Central where military operations against them have been very pronounced. Niger State Commissioner for Local Government, Internal Security and Chieftaincy Affairs, Emmanuel Umar, confirmed the development to newsmen in an interactive session in Minna on Tuesday. He said: “In the last one week or so, there have been intensive military operations in the area, from Mashegu to Borgu up to Mokwa, they (terrorists) are already being dislodged.” IN CASE YOU MISSED THESE FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE He assured that government will not fold its arms and allow the terrorists to settle in the Kainji National Park which is a vast forest spreading up to the neighbouring Republic of Benin. Umar, however, blamed the activities of bandits on the large landmass of the state, the inaccessibility of towns and villages because of their difficult terrains and lack of communication. “One farm alone in Niger is larger than Lagos state, so you can understand what we are facing here,” he said. According to the commissioner, findings reveal that bandits were being attracted to parts of the state especially areas with viable cattle and agricultural produce markets for economic gains but said the government has stepped up assaults against the terrorists. “We have stepped up our game to make sure that the bandits don’t return to these areas,” he said.
