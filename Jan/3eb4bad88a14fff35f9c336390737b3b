American Delta Air Lines has reported financial results for the December quarter and full year 2021 and provided its outlook for the March quarter, 2022. According to Delta’s Chief Executive Officer, Ed Bastian, “2021 was a year like no other for Delta, with significant progress in our recovery supported by growing brand preference, enabling us to be the only major U.S. airline to deliver profitability across the second half of the year. As always, our people drove this success which is why we were happy to announce a special profit-sharing payment for all eligible employees. “While the rapidly spreading omicron variant had significantly impacted staffing levels and disrupted travel across the industry, Delta’s operation had stabilised over the last week and returned to pre-holiday performance. Omicron is expected to temporarily delay the demand recovery by 60 days, but as we look past the peak, we are confident in a strong spring and summer travel season with significant pent-up demand for consumer and business travel.” Announcing its December quarter 2021 financial results, Delta recorded adjusted pre-tax income of $170 million excluding a net impact of $564 million primarily in equity method losses, mark-to-market adjustments on investments and special profit-sharing payment.

For the full year 2021 financial results, the airline had adjusted pre-tax loss of $3.4 billion excluding a net benefit of $3.8 billion from items primarily related to the Payroll Support Programs (PSP), partially offset by equity method losses, debt extinguishment charges and special profit-sharing payment.
