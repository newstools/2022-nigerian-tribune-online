Davido’s Public Relations Manager, Aladegbola Oluwasegun Oluwadamilare, has noted that there is nothing like publicity stunts about his employer’s generosity. The PR expert better known as IamDre disclosed this in a recent interview while reacting to the fact that a lot of people think Davido’s generosity is a publicity stunt. He said: “David Has been selfless from time, there is nothing like a publicity stunt or public relations (PR) about his generosity. “David is not the only generous artiste in the business but why do you think his name is the loudest? ‘Lifestyle’ Davido is the biggest in the business, his great music, lifestyle and legacy speak for themselves. This is not hype, everything he does makes the most noise, anything he does makes the news, Davido is the news.” Speaking on Davido’s work ethics since working with him, IamDre said: “I must confess at this point that Davido is bigger than PR. In a week, there are over 23 Davido news publications, both true and false news, which shows you how big and powerful he is and plays his roles in the industry.

For instance, the N250 million Davido raised for the orphanage was never a PR stunt and will never be. It’s his lifestyle. “That day, Davido jokingly made a video to say he has been uplifting people all these years and it was high time his friends showed appreciation with a million Naira each. “DMW crew members moved to surprise him with the sum of one million Naira each and then, the moment he posted his bank details on his IG story, the game was on standstill, David was trending globally. That is the power of OBO Lifestyle.”  How Adetunji Made Over N20million In 2021 From Football Trading. Click Here To Join His Team!
