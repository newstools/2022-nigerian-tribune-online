He passed on in a private hospital in Abuja in the early hour of today. “The late Oba Adepoju was deposed by former governor of Ondo State, Dr. Olusegun Mimiko, on grounds of misunderstanding between the monarch and his wife. “Before his transition to the eternal glory, the deposed monarch prayed for the peace of Akure kingdom. He said he did his best in defending his people while on the throne.
