The Erei communities have over the years been at loggerheads over a piece of land that was established by the defunct Eastern Region before the Nigerian Civil War as Oil Palm Plantation Settlement. The settlement was handed over to the Cross River State Government shortly after the Nigerian civil war of 1967 to 1970, given that the location is in the state.
