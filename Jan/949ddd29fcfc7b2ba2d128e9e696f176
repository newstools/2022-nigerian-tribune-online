A housewife, Ismaha Adam, has dragged her husband, Abdullahi Zakariyya to a Sharia Court sitting in Magajin Gari, Kaduna State, seeking divorce over unsettled differences. Adam who lives in Kaduna, told the court that she would no longer be able to obey her husband’s  instructions at home. She also said that she was willing to pay back the N40,000 dowry paid by Abdullahi as her bride price to terminate their marriage. The defendant, Abdullahi, a businessman pleaded with the court to give him time to resolve the problems between him and his wife. He alleged that his wife was seeking divorce because of the current economic challenges affecting him. “I am not economically buoyant as I used to be, however, I am trying my best to see that I shoulder my responsibilities.  She left my house three days ago and I don’t know her whereabouts. “I pleaded with her before court sitting but she did not respond. I even met her guardians twice to help me pacify her, but she refused to attend meetings arranged by them,”Abdullahi  said. He prayed the court to give him time to consult his wife guardians towards settling their differences. The judge, Murtala Nasir, after listening to both parties, adjourned the case. 100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>Click Here Now! << How Adetunji Made Over N20million In 2021 From Football Trading.
