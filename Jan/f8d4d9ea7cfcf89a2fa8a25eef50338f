Starting the new year on a high note with new goals set and the determination to achieve those goals is one of the many ways anyone would make a difference in their profession. Having studied the  Nigerian music industry and all that it  comprises US based Nigerian born music stars, Ojo Oluwafolayemi Victor and Godspower Ogide professionally known by their stage names Vikul and PWR Bank respectively,  have concluded plans to launch themselves into the industry with the intended release of their new song “Ajebutter”. The sound which is set to hit the airwaves soon is meant to bring them into limelight and introduce them into the industry as Nigerian artistes while still maintaining their relevance in the wider world. While speaking about their plans for the new year, both singers have expressed their  eagerness to explore the Nigerian music space and gain recognition enough to give them a chance at fame and to increase their fanbase at home. “Making this song was a whole new level for me, and I’m super excited about it. I personally believe it is a step in the right direction. Despite the fact that we’ve based abroad, this song is just to prove that one never forgets their roots, we are Nigerians and we will always be”, Vilux said. “We have done our research and we are ever ready for the task ahead of us, we want to leave a mark on the minds of everyone that listens to our songs. So people should watch this space for the things we have in store for them. Our plan is to take over the Nigerian music industry and releasing this new song would give us a head start. I’m confident that this journey will be the beginning of bigger and better things to be achieved in 2022”, PWR Bank added.
