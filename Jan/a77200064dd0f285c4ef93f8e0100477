According to S&P, Access Bank’s ‘B-/B’ long- and short-term ratings was affirmed and  its national scale rating raised to ‘ngBBB+/ngA-2’ from ‘ngBBB/ngA-2’.

It raised its national scale rating on GTBank to better reflect its leading market position in Nigeria, strong profitability, and earnings stability through the cycle. According to S&P, revision of the national scale ratings of the top-tier Nigerian banks as well as two mid-tier banks is underpinned by their resilience to various shocks over the past few years, which it expects will continue. The banking sector in Nigeria (B-/Stable/B) is exposed to short credit cycles because of the volatility of oil prices, but the performance of top-tier and some mid-tier banks continued to improve. Nevertheless, “we cap the ratings on Nigerian banks at the level of the sovereign ratings because of the likely direct and indirect influence of sovereign distress on their operations, including their ability to service foreign currency obligations. Therefore, we have affirmed all our global scale ratings on these banks, including our ratings on their parent companies,” it stated. How Adetunji Made Over N20million In 2021 From Football Trading.
