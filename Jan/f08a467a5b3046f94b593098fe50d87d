Nollywood Actress Juliet Ibrahim has cried out over wrong information emanating from her Wikipedia profile that she got married to popular video jockey, television presenter and entrepreneur, Adams Ibrahim Adebola better known as VJ Adams. The beautiful actress said she is still single and should be allowed to remain so till she gets someone to marry. She made this clarification via her verified Instagram page, where she said that someone unknown to her has been editing her Wikipedia page online and the person wrongly indicated that ‘Juliet’s spouse is VJ Adams aka Mr. Ibrahim’ She, however, called out the person to edit that out as she was single and not married. She also explained that she only did a bridal shoot project with VJ Adams and that shouldn’t translate to the fact that they were officially married. “I am an actor, model, brand ambassador, speaker and a host, I work with colleagues on various projects and doesn’t mean because I did a bridal shoot project with @iamvjadams we are officially married. This is PSA! Please help a sister out to stay single until she actually gets married. Thank you for removing that online,” she wrote.
