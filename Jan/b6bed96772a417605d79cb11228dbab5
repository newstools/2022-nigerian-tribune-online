President Buhari’s genuine intentions for Nigerians are solidly in mind even with current predicaments of human barbecue, kidnapping and killing of some innocent citizens particularly in northern Nigeria. Undeniably, northern Nigeria has been bedevilled with insecurity challenges of various types, ranging from kidnapping, armed banditry, Boko Haram, among others. With the recent brutal killing of 15 worshipers in Niger, the assassination of Katsina State Commissioner of Police and the abduction of six people in Abuja, thousands of northerners make have started reconsidering their ardent support for Buhari. These point to the fact that the present government has failed to fulfil its primary responsibility of securing lives and property. Many are of the opinion that the events are a dirty slap on the president’s face given the fact that he is from northern Nigeria and he came to power on the horseback of his pedigree as a former military ruler with a good understanding of security issues. With the current predicaments, northerners are no longer interested in Buhari’s style of leadership: he neither visits the scene of events nor take quick actions, but travelled to Lagos for a book launch amidst the mourning of the 42 innocent travellers gruesomely killed by bandits. Very sad and pathetic that amidst the human barbecue, among other unwelcome events, he chose to be in Lagos for a book launch. This simply shows that people’s lives no longer matter to the President. Therefore, I am calling on the president to immediately do the needful and show that people’s lives matter to him and his administration Finally, we all have a role to play. Buhari alone can’t do it.  Ukasha Rabiu Magama, Bauchi State.
