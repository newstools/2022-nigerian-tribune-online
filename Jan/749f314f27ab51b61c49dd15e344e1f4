Technology is shaping so many industries today. The healthcare industry isn’t far behind this notion. It’s positive enough to say that healthcare is significantly improving thanks to technology. Those improvements begin in the foundation of healthcare—clinical research. Clinical research refers to everything encompassing what’s being used now in healthcare. In addition, clinical research significantly improves patient care, from drug development to new treatment forms. This also brings in a better morbidity rate, giving patients a brand new hope with advancements in science, clinical research, and, subsequently, medicine. With that in mind, here’s a list of the top five tech trends in clinical research that are positively shaping the industry. Then, go further with your newly-gained information by visiting this site to learn more here. The advancements in technology today have also paved the way for the observance of more patient-centric research and trial. This enables pharmaceutical companies to develop smaller trials to take to heart the patient’s best interest. For example, patients subject to particular clinical research can now use wearable devices to help monitor their health. The wearables can hold data regarding medications given, dosage instructions, and even reminders about when the next checkup will be. Moreover, this advantage allows patients to have more insights into their progress and condition through clinical research and trial. Using artificial intelligence (AI) across various industries isn’t something novel. But, it’s worth highlighting as a forerunner tech trend in clinical research today. In fact, with its rapid growth in demand in the industry, it’s safe to say that there isn’t any better time but now to utilize the full potential of AI for clinical research. AI, for instance, is found to be effective in mitigating the risk of preventable medical scenarios. There are different ways by which this is done so, such as: Since the pandemic hit, remote working suddenly became the ‘new normal’ work arrangement. This applies, even in the clinical research sector. What can be done at home by workers is welcomed through remote working in the clinical research industry. However, only those employees who have to report to the physical laboratory are asked to work in a physical office setting. Many more medical industries acknowledge this shift to remote working as effective, remote, or hybrid clinical trials are here to stay. This phenomenon in clinical research is also known as decentralized clinical trials. For instance, clinical trials and research done remotely can also mean where the patient lives. On top of all the advantages it brings, one of the most pressing is how decentralized clinical trials and research were also seen to significantly lessen the burden placed on the participants themselves. The shifting towards a remote or virtual arrangement is not limited to work per se. Even the training of the clinical research team is currently being done virtually or online. Remember that well-trained staff is the key to a successful clinical trial. Hence, even in the absence or limitation in physical interaction, the need for training is still present. This need doesn’t have to be hampered when clinical research training is available. All thanks to technology, remote clinical research training is now still possible. When patients submit themselves to clinical research and training, the pharmaceutical companies running such need to monitor patients regularly and closely. Otherwise, they might risk having patients who do not adhere to the medications given. With AI, remote patient monitoring is another tech trend that’s a norm with clinical research done. Even startup companies are now developing their own efficient patient monitoring systems with higher and better accuracy. Conclusion If there’s anything that the medical and clinical industry has seen in recent years, this has to do with the rising use of technology. There’s no denying the significant improvements technology can bring, particularly in healthcare. When healthcare sectors use technology to their advantage, clinical research drastically gets better. Thus, take note of the tech trends above, albeit only a few. If you’re in the clinical research sector, those are worth emulating and practicing from this year, moving forward.
