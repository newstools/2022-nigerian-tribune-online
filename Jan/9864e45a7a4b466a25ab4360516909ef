Before the screening, guests were ushered to a separate area of the venue, which had been converted into a dinner setting, perched on plush, lounge-style chairs stationed around a stage where a full live band performed some irresistible Nigerian classics that got guests dancing. After an hour of mixing and mingling, it was time for Denrele Edun to host the gala portion of the evening, blowing the roof off the venue with his hosting prowess, before industry veterans and Inkblot’s collaborators congratulated Inkblot in a video mash-up that was played on the giant screen. Inkblot co-founders Naz Onuzo, Zulumoke Oyibo, and Damola Ademola also chronicled their amazing feats of the last 10 years and reeled out what is next for the production house. Guests went out of their way to make bold fashion statements with their fabulous outfits, making the premiere the talk of the town and getting people eager to see the movie once it hits the cinemas.
