Nine communities in Bukkuyum Local Government Area of Zamfara State were asked by bandits to pay N24m compulsory ‘tax’ or be attacked. A resident of the area who pleaded for anonymity remarked that the bandits have directed the communities to pay as much as N500,000 to N5 million. Findings gathered that the affected communities have started mobilising to pay the bandits, even as locals said letters to that effect have since reached the affected communities through kidnap victims who regained freedom. The source listed the communities as Yangalma, Tungar Gebe, Wawan Iccen Ibrahim, Wawan Iccen Salihu, Galle, Nannarki, Ruwan Kura, Gangara and Gaude. Recall, the bandits 10 days ago, stayed in Gando forest and launched attacks on seven communities in Bukkuyum and Anka Local Government Areas leading to the death of hundreds of people, while over 1,900 cows were rustled. “Some of the community leaders who received letters from the bandits reported the matter to the authorities,” according to a local. However, at the time of filing this report, there has been no reaction from the police or government.
