Atiku Abubakar is one leader who regards all tribes in Nigeria equally. He is visionary and detrabalised. Some of the places where his detribalised nature comes to play are the organisations he owns, where workers are placed according to their qualifications with no religion or tribal sentiment. To achieve lasting peace in Nigeria, tribalism and religious bigotry must be defeated. His commitment to the unity of Nigeria, was exemplified when he influenced General Musa Yaradua to step down for MKO Abiola in SDP in 1993. After the demise of Moshood Kashimawo Abiola (MKO), he was advised to contest for the presidency but he declined, saying the Yoruba President elect could not die in the regime held by a Northern President and a Northerner would still emerge as presidential candidate. That, he said, would lead to disunity and tribal war. Formal Vice President Atiku Abubakar is needed at the helm of affairs of a nation if the truth must prevail. There is no greatness, where there is no simplicity, goodness and truth. His reputation for the transparency and dogged pursuit of due process and rule of law ensured peace in Nigeria when he was defeated by President Muhammadu Buhari in 2019.
