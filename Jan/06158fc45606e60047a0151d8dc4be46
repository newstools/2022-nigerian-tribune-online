The Minister of Transportation, Rt. Hon. Chibuike Amaechi has expressed his satisfaction with the increased pace of work on the construction of the Lekki Deep Sea Port. Amaechi made this comment in Lagos recently during his inspection of the port site in Ibeju-Lekki, Lagos, in the company of top government functionaries from the Federal Ministry of Transportation and heads of relevant agencies, including the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) and the Nigerian Shippers Council (NSC). Speaking shortly after his tour of the port site, the Minister commended the promoters on the pace of work. He urged them to double their effort on the construction to complete the port and start operations ahead of schedule. “I am happy. From the last time we came here, there has been huge progress; what this shows is that when you set your mind on something, you can achieve it. The agreement was that we would commission by the last quarter of 2022, but if we double our effort on this project, we could commission by July or August, and that would be great,” he said.
