The building harbouring the church is located opposite Rain Oil Filling Station by the Redeemed junction, along Okpanam Road in Asaba. Feelers said besides the dead, scores of people are still trapped in the building while police operatives have cordoned off the area for a proper rescue operation. The building, which is being used for the first time, reportedly collapsed at about 5:55 p.m. during a Tuesday evening service. Reports said eight persons have been rescued unhurt, while four persons have been rushed to the Asaba Specialist Hospital. Secretary to the State Government, Chief Patrick Ukah; the State Commissioner for Health, Dr Ononye Mordi, a team of Red Cross officers, and firefighters were on the ground on a rescue mission.
