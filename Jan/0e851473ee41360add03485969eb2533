PROMINENT Lagos indigenes under the aegis of Omo Eko Pataki, on Thursday said year 2023 is the defining moment to turn the fortunes of Lagos around, charging Lagosians to speak out loud and clear in total rejection of the way and manner in which they are being sidelined in governance of the state. The group gave the charge in a statement titled: “Lagos: Time for  a new Order,” signed by its chairman, Chief Olabode George, Major-General Tajudeen Olanrewaju (rtd) and Mr. Gbadebo Dallass, both trustees, and Prince Uthman Shodipe-Dosunmu, the general secretary, copy of which was made available to newsmen. Omo Eko Pataki, while giving the charge, further called on their fellow compatriots to go beyond the limiting confines of partisanship, work selflessly with steadfast and brave hearts, defiant of what it termed “oppressor’s insolence,” and ensure they “vote out those who have held us in thralldom for 21 years.” The group demanded that Lagos must start on a new slate, saying that the era politics of jaundiced nepotism, where everything had to be by dictates and consent of a godfather was over. According to the statement, “this is perhaps the most critical year in the chequered history of the Nigerian union. As 2023 draws nearer,  we move closer to the great unknown.  The year 2023 is the Lagosian inflection point. It is our defining moment to turn the fortunes of our state around and restore a new equitable order. “But it cannot be done alone. Together, men and women of goodwill must come to the barricades and speak out loud and clear in total rejection of the tyrannical man of straw who would play God with our ancestral holdings.” .While noting that Lagos, which was once regarded as state of excellence and “once determined the Nigerian fortune, has now been reduced to another backwater debtor state owing well over N3.28 trillion in domestic debts alone despite generating  N665 billion every year in Internally Generated Revenue (IGR),” the group declared that a lot was definitely wrong with governance of our state. The statement added:”All beginnings must have an end. Lagosians must collectively hold their own fortunes in their hands. They must decide the way forward towards peace, harmony and genuine democracy. This is now a contention beyond partisan affiliation. It is a coalitional fight for our freedom and for the emancipation of generations yet unborn. “The historic mobilisation has begun. The challenges ahead  may be tough. The grapple with those who presently wield nauseating privileges will be tense and fierce. But we dare not fail nor falter. It is indeed a struggle between light and darkness, between the forces of malignity  and the forces of good.” YOU SHOULD NOT MISS THESE HEADLINES FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE We Have Not Had Water Supply In Months ― Abeokuta Residents In spite of the huge investment in the water sector by the government and international organisations, water scarcity has grown to become a perennial nightmare for residents of Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital.
