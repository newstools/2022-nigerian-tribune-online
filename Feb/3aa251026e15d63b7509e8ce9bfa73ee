Out of the deep affection and great respect that I have for the Oyo State Governor, Engr. Seyi Makinde, Oyo State Commissioner of Police, Madam Ngozi Onadeko and Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, Mr. Adaralewa Micheal, I think this is right time for me to publicly inform you all that this trend of armed robbery attack in Ibadan calls for more concern as the loss of lives incurred by members of the public has become alarming and shocking. The typical example of this was what happened at Idi Ape in Iwo road Ibadan last Friday, where the dare devil armed robbers attacked a bullion van and killed policemen including the members of the public including Sulaimon Mubarak, the personal assistant to the Resident Electoral Commissioner in Osun state. I sympathise with the family members of those who lost their lives to this incident. It is time for relevant authorities to sit up and launch a thorough investigation into the terrible incident. The rising wave of armed robbery attack is not directed at bullion vans alone; members of the public as well are not spared from the attacks. Stakeholders must come together and find a way to combat rising insecurity by curbing it before it gets out of hand. A stitch in time saves nine.  Barrister Jimoh Mumin, Ibadan
