KANO State governor, Dr Umar Abdullahi Ganduje, has read a riot act to Fulani herders threatening death sentence or life imprisonment for whoever is involved in cattle rustling or banditry. This was just as Ganduje said that open grazing is today an old model and is gradually being phased out. Therefore Kano has since adopted a new model or Ruga settlement which would give the herders economic viability. According to him, “Since our negotiation with the Fulani herders to stop cattle rustling, Kano has seen peace and development, while the government continues doing good for the herders. Therefore, any move to get involved in criminalities would be faced with a stiff penalty.” Ganduje gave the warning while speaking at Kadawa Garun Mallam Local Government Area of the state, while vaccinating one million cows on the formal launch of the State-Wide Mass Cattle and Small Ruminants Vaccination, over the weekend. He, however, reminded them that his government has done a lot for Fulani herders in Kano, such as building a Ruga settlement for them to keep annual vaccinations. Therefore the herders have no reason whatsoever to be criminals. Ganduje also reminded them that last year the government vaccinated 703,000 cattles, with 664,000 ruminants and these animals have not faced any infectious outbreaks, making them target one million cattle to produce healthy animals. He said, “We have succeeded over time  in tackling cattle rustling and banditry in Kano, and anybody who moots the idea of getting involved in either rustling or banditry would be jailed for life or sentenced to death without option.”  ORITAMEFA BAPTIST MODEL SCHOOLS, (OBMS), IBADAN
