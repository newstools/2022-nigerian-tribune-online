SEQUEL to signing into law the Electoral Act 2022 Amendment Bill by President Muhammadu Buhari, the chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Professor Mahmood Yakubu, has announced new dates for 2023 general election. Addressing a gathering of National Commissioners and journalists on Saturday, Professor Yakubu said the presidential and National Assembly elections would now hold on February 25, while the governorship and state Houses of Assembly elections will hold on Saturday, March 11, 2023. It will be recalled that the elections had earlier been fixed for February 18 for presidential and National Assembly elections, while March 4, 2023 was the initial date given for state elections. Professor Yakubu said the new dates were in deference to the provisions of the new law, as he noted that the commission could not release the detailed timetable and schedule of activities for the general election, as it normally would, because of the pendency of a new electoral law. “The Bill has now been signed into law. Therefore, the Electoral Act 2022, together with the 1999 Constitution (as amended), forms the legal basis for conducting all elections in Nigeria. “In particular, the Electoral Act provides strict timelines for the implementation of electoral activities based on the date of the general election. “One of the significant timelines is the publication of notice of election not later than 360 days before the day appointed for holding an election which has now lapsed for the 2023 general election. “Consequently, the commission has decided to adjust the dates of the 2023 general election to ensure compliance with the provisions of the new law. “Accordingly, the presidential and National Assembly elections will now hold on Saturday, 25th February 2023, while the governorship and state Houses of Assembly elections will hold two weeks later on Saturday 11th March 2023. With this adjustment, the 2023 general election is now 363 days away.” Giving a breakdown of what he called “critical time bound activities,” the INEC chairman said the publication of notice of election would be released on Monday 28th February, 2022, while political parties are expected to have concluded their primaries and resolve disputes arising from them between Monday, 4th of April 2022 and Friday 3rd June 2022. Others are “Submission of nomination forms to INEC via the online portal for presidential and National Assembly election – 9.00am on Friday 10th June 2022 to 6.00pm on Friday 17th June 2022. “Submission of nomination forms to INEC via the online nomination portal for governorship and state assembly elections – 9.00am on Friday 1st July 2022 to 6.00pm on Friday 15th July 2022. “Commencement of campaign by political parties for presidential and National Assembly election – Wednesday 28th September 2022 and Commencement of Campaign by political parties for governorship and state Assembly elections – Wednesday 12th October 2022.” The INEC chairman gave midnight of Thursday 23rd February 2023, as last day of campaign by political parties for presidential and National Assembly elections and midnight of Thursday 9th March 2023, as last day of campaign by political parties for governorship and state assembly elections. He cautioned political parties to stick to the timelines and schedules issued by his commission as he hinted that “any political party that refuses to comply with schedule of activities would not be eligible to field candidates.” ORITAMEFA BAPTIST MODEL SCHOOLS, (OBMS), IBADAN
