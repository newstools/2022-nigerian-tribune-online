Olanrewaju testifying said, My wife started misbehaving after we got married in May 1995. “She has no respect for me as the head of the home. She addresses me rudely and is always ready to fight me. “Any time Fatima fights with me, she will beat me and grab my manhood. “She has a caustic tongue and ridicules me before our neighbours and family members. Fatima calls me a bastard and lazy man. She uses so many unprintable words on me in their presence. According to the plaintiff, the defendant has been arrested by the police at the Iyana-Church Police Station for causing breach of peace in the neighbourhood in 2004. “Fatima is also always rude to my mother and relatives.
