Nigerian-American controversial actress, Judith Opara Mazagwu, popularly known as Afrocandy is bereaved. She lost her mother, Mama Agatha Opara aged 85 some days back and has been mourning and holding on to fond memories of her. Afrocandy has, however, revealed that what she would miss about her late mother, describing her as one woman who never discriminated against anyone and loved all equally. Speaking about her lifestyle and how her mother never knew she was a porn star, Afrocandy added that, “To be honest, she only knew my career when I was a regular actress back in Nigeria and blessed me. As I became Afrocandy she didn’t know about all that.” On how she received the news of her death, Afrocandy, noted that she had been keeping a close tab on her since she was ill and that her elder sister informed her around 3 am last Monday when she breathed her last. “Though she was hospitalised last week and discharged just two days ago, I was communicating with my siblings all the time. I was always on video calls with her. I was with her physically some years ago and was praying to see her one more time when I visit home,” she said Speaking on what she will miss most about her mother, Afrocandy dislcosed that her stories, advice, and kindness to all and sundry will be greatly missed, adding that, “My mother would cook 10 cups of rice in case we had strangers. She would dish out the last food in the pot for you and lick the bottom of the pot pretending not to be hungry. She was the bravest human being I ever knew because she was hardworking.” ORITAMEFA BAPTIST MODEL SCHOOLS, (OBMS), IBADAN
