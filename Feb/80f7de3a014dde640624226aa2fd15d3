The Executive Secretary of the Nigerian Christian Pilgrim Commission (NCPC), Rev. Dr Yakubu Pam and his delegation have visited Amman, Jordan for the onground preparation for the forthcoming pilgrimage exercise to Israel and Jordan. It will be recalled that the Nigerian Christian Pilgrim Commission (NCPC), working with the mandate given to the Commission to conduct pilgrimage activities to holy sites around the world, last year included Jordan on the list of her pilgrimage destination and successfully conducted the pilgrimage exercise to the Kingdom of Jordan amidst the COVID-19 global pandemic. The visit was to ascertain the preparedness of the ground handlers, visit the holy sites and inspect the hotels for intending pilgrims and as well inspect the aircraft at Queen Alia Airport. The kingdom of Jordan is a home to religious, archeological and tourist sites, with the population of about 11 million, of which 97 per cent are Muslims and three per cent Christians; it is recorded to be the most peaceful country in the Middle East. The NCPC boss and the pilgrimage managers were received in Jordan with great grandeur, which clearly shows the acceptance of the Christian Pilgrimage in the Kingdom of Jordan.
