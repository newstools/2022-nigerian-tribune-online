The West African Examination Council (WAEC) has cancelled the entire results of some candidates who were alleged of malpractice and later found guilty of the offence during three of its examinations between 2020 and 2021 including the last school-based West African Senior School Certificate examinations and the two previous editions for private candidates. It has also banned some candidates from sitting for any of its exams for two years and cancelled some papers in the results of some other candidates all over malpractice in the same exams while derecognizing some schools for a certain number of years or for life and some supervisors and invigilators to be punished for their ignoble roles during the conduct of the various examinations. These decisions were made by the Nigeria Examinations Committee (NEC) of WAEC, which is the highest decision-making organ of WAEC concerning examination related matters at its 72nd Meeting held in Lagos last weekend, without being specific about numbers.

The committee, which also said the withheld results of candidates, who had been exonerated of wrongdoing, would equally be released immediately, further explained that it would likewise act on some special cases and appeals for clemency by some candidates of its 2021 WASSCE who are on the bid to restitute based on their new religious faith. The committee also noted that it considered the General Résumé of the Chief Examiners Reports on all the council’s mentioned exams and observed that the standards of the questions papers and that of marking guidelines were all according to syllabus and world best practices. The committee, however, expressed satisfaction with the results of candidates who sat the last school-based examination with over 80 per cent of them performing well and congratulated WAEC management and other stakeholders on the feat.
