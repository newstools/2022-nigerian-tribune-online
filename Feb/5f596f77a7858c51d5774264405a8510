THE purported arraignment of three suspected killers of a 5-year-old pupil, Hanifa Abubakar, before Kano State High Court was stalled on Monday due to lack of legal representation for each of the suspects. The suspects are Abdulmalik Tanko, Hashimu Isiyaku and Fatima Bashir. They are standing trial on the allegation of kidnapping, torturing and killing Hanifa Abubakar and requested the sum of N6 million ransom from her parent. It will also be recalled that on January 24 the defendants were arraigned before Chief Magistrate Muhammmad Jibril on a 4-count charge of kidnapping, culpable homicide, conspiracy, concealment of a child and abduction. IN CASE YOU MISSED THESE FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE It will be recalled that when the case came up on Monday, before Justice Usman Naabba of Kano State High court for arraignment, the defendants were not legally represented. They however prayed the court to order Kano State Government to provide legal representation for them. In his response after announcing his appearance, the Prosecution Counsel led by Kano State Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Barrister Musa Abdullahi Lawan, sought an adjournment to enable the state to provide legal representation for the three defendants. The prosecutor said: “My Lord! We are constrained to go on with the case today, the defendants are asking the state to provide legal services for them. Perhaps that is the position of the law.” The case adjourned to February 14, 2022, for arraignment.
