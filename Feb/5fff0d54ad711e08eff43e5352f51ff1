MR Sylvester Oromoni Snr., father of the late Dowen College student, has alleged a cover-up between the Nigeria Police Force and Lagos State Directorate of Public Prosecutions (DPP) over the circumstances surrounding his son’s death. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Oromoni Snr. made the allegations on Tuesday at an Ikeja Coroner’s Court, while being cross-examined by Mr Akin George, counsel to the Lagos State government. Oromomi Snr. raised questions about why the five senior students of Dowen College, who allegedly bullied his son, were exonerated and released by the DPP’s advice 14 days into the 21- day remand order given by a Yaba Magistrates’ Court. He noted that the Magistrate Court had given the 21-day remand order to give the police time to carry out investigations into the matter. The witness, who was very emotional and often broke down in tears during his testimony, questioned the timing of the release of the five students by the DPP. Meanwhile, an Ikeja Coroner’s Court is to subpoena more witnesses in the quest to unravel the circumstances that led to the death of Oromoni Jnr. The Coroner, Mr Mikhail Kadiri, made the disclosure at the conclusion of pro- ceedings on Tuesday. He noted that the inquest is a fact-finding exercise and a lot of questions would need to be answered.
