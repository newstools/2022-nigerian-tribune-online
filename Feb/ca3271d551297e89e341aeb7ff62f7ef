In the weeks ahead, Cordros Capital expect the NGX floor to be flooded with corporate earnings as more companies publish their audited 2021FY numbers, accompanied by dividend declarations. “As things stand, we believe investors have fully priced-in dividend expectations. Hence, we think positive surprises from dividend-paying stocks would provide a catalyst for increased buying activities. Notwithstanding, we advise investors to seek trading opportunities in only fundamentally justified stocks as the weak macro story remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings,” Cordros analysts advised in its report.
