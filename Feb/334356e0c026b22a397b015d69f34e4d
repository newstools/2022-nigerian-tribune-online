IN CASE YOU MISSED THESE FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE “You know we’ve always promised that it’s going to be the end of this month, but he gave me an assurance today that the report on the constitution review would be laid before the end of next week. “And I can assure you, it’s a great step towards making Nigeria a greater nation. That is why in preparation we have to put in preparation for the voting in place, in order to assure Nigerians of the accuracy of the voting that was why we took that step on the technology on the electronic voting. “So that nobody would say the ‘ayes’ were not up to two-thirds and take us to court. It would be obvious that every man would vote from his seat against his own name, the number will show there, how many people voted for or against. This will be taking place immediately after the report is laid,” Hon Kalu said.
