ASPIRANTS anxious to purchase nomination forms ahead of the National Con- vention of the All Progressives Congress (APC) fixed for February 26 got the shock of their lives on Monday as they were turned back from Buhari House, the APC’s national secretariat, Abuja. Checks by Nigerian Tribune revealed that the All Progressives Congress Caretaker/ Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee at the end of its meeting in January had announced that the sale of nomination forms for the substantive National Working Committee (NWC) positions would start on February 14, while aspirants were expected to have completed the forms and returned it by February 19. Feelers from the party na- tional secretariat revealed that certain chairmanship aspirants who sent emissaries to pick forms for them were disap- pointed as they were told that the forms were not ready. Investigation by Nigerian Tribune revealed that the APC CECPC was wary of com- mencement of sale of forms when the contentious issue of zoning of national offices has not been settled. A party source also told Nigerian Tribune in confidence that some of the governors pushing for a deal on consensus national chairman got their plot undermined as the meeting of the Progressives Governors Forum expected to hold last Sunday was aborted at the last minute. A member of the APC CECPC who spoke with Nigerian Tribune said the delay in sale of forms expected to commence on Monday was nothing to worry about. Asked if a new timeline would be announced, the source told Nigerian Tribune to wait till tomorrow (today) . “I can’t give you details on phone now. I told you, the convention will hold as scheduled.” Also an aspirant from the North-East for the office of national chairman, Sylvester Moniedafe, expressed disappointment over the delay. Another aspirant for the office of national chairman from North- Central, Saliu Mustapha, however, said the development was nothing to worry about.
