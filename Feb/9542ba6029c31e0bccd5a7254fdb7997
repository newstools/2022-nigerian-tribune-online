Nigeria’s next President must be a Southerner and Christian, because the Northerners and Muslims would have served their term of eight years out in 2023 through Gen Muhammadu Buhari. We cannot run away from religion being a key factor in our political structure. The North and Southern structure can also not be overlooked. I therefore implore the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), to champion the cause because it isn not strange to project such a cause. In 2014, some Muslim associations championed the cause of Buhari to be Nigeria’s President. Honestly religion has become part of our unwritten constitution, just as the rotation between North and south. The Northerners should also be reminded that their leaders had ruled Nigeria for 45 years out of 61 years of the country’s independence. A statement by one of the presidential aspirants that a Muslim/Muslim ticket can fly in Nigeria is a grave affront on Christians and this would be rejected, any attempt to foist Muslim/Muslim candidates on the nation cannot succeed. Also, it is o longer feasible for old and sick politicians continue to foist themselves on us as President. Enough is enough; Nigeria is bleeding profusely and in dire need of young, highly educated, committed, visionary, world-class, patriotic and selfless leaders. We need resourceful, unbiased and highly cerebral candidates that should be sponsored by our political parties, come 2023 general elections.
