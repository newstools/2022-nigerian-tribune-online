Dealers at Parthian Partners said the treasury bills market traded with mild bullish sentiment on Thursday, with activity skewed to the long end of the curve, notably the new one year Nigeria Treasury Bill paper. The buzz was short lived according to them, and the market remained calm till the end of the trading session, with executed trades skewed to mid and long dated papers. The bond market had a bullish session at close of last week with large ticket transactions being executed. Players showed bids across the curve, with short end papers recording the highest drop in reaction to the decline in NTB auction stop rates.
