Enugu street is bare with shops and offices locked up in compliance with the special sit-at-home protest held in solidarity with the detained IPOB leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu currently undergoing trial at the Federal High Court Abuja before Justice Binta Nyako. All markets, shopping centres, supermarkets, restaurants, motor parks, schools, banks, garages and even government offices are all locked to the public. There is a light mixed security patrol without the Neighborhood Watch groups one of whose commandants named Jango was hacked down by unknown gunmen last week. Indeed, last week also saw the killing of over a dozen persons in Enugu including checkpoint duty policemen. However, as at press time, there has no security lapses or any bizarre happenings today in Enugu.
