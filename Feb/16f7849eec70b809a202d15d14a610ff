In the interest of global peace, world leaders including African leaders should act fast and call the Russian President to order so that he can withdraw his troops from Ukraine before this will start a third world war which we cannot afford at this period. The ongoing heavy bombardment of Ukraine by Russian soldiers is not a good development. Ukraine that is known to be a peaceful country is now under siege over an issue that should not degenerate. While Ukraine is not ready to surrender, we know that Russian is more powerful than Ukraine; Russian has over 13, 000 weapon of mass destruction, more than enough ammunition to fight Ukraine. World leaders should stop thinking of imposing sanctions to stop this on-going war against Ukraine because this will not stop calamity. The Ukraine president called for help from other countries but Russia is set to attack any nation that wants to support Ukraine. World leaders must come together at this critical time to save the lives of Ukrainian people before the Russian president kills the whole nation. The attack on Ukraine is wholly unjustified. Some countries have not recovered from the problem of Covid-19 which paralysed the economy of many nations. ALSO READ FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE This on-going war against Ukraine must stop. Putin should give peace a chance and world leaders have a responsibility to put an end to this. Nobody is going salute Putin for this unprovoked attack against Ukraine.
