Over 4,000 beneficiaries of the Extended Special Public Works (ESPW) programme of the federal government have cried over non-payment of their stipends in Zamfara State. The Nigerian Tribune gathered that many of the recruited participants are yet to receive their monthly N20,000 promised them while some were paid for only one month. It was further gathered that the three-month programme was approved by President Muhammadu Buhari last year to mitigate problems associated with lack of employment in rural areas through a short-term engagement. It was further learned that the beneficiaries had carried out public works such as sweeping streets, culverts, hospitals after the programme was launched across the state. It was gathered that many of the selected beneficiaries in Zamfara State who have completed the public works within the three months provided are yet to be paid the N20,000 promised by the federal government. Mallam Aliyu from Bungudu Local Government Area who is among the 14,000 youths recruited for ESPW said he received only a month stipend and he is still waiting to collect his remaining N40,000 for the two months.
