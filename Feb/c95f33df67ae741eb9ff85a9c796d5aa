The Ogun State Governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun, has urged members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Oyo State, to use the death of the former Governor of the state, Otunba Christopher Alao Akala, to unite and work together for the success of the party. This was the goodwill message of the Ogun State Governor, at an event, tagged “A Day of Tributes”, organised by the associates of the late former Governor at Jogor Centre, Ibadan, on Monday, to kickstart his final burial ceremonies. Represented by the Publicity Secretary of APC in Ogun State, Comrade Tunde Oladunjoye, Abiodun, who described late Alao Akala as a “bridge-builder” commended political leaders and stakeholders of Oyo APC for coming together to honour their deceased leader, advising them to use the opportunity of his death to unite and work together for the 2023 general elections. LSO READ FROM  NIGERIAN TRIBUNE “The death of Otunba Alao-Akala, has robbed the political space of a most charismatic grassroots politician, who loved his people, and in turn enjoyed their trust and enthusiastic support,” Abiodun said. Speaking further, the Ogun Governor remarked that “Alao-Akala’s family has lost a family man and dotting patriarch, whose records of service to the nation included a career in the Nigerian Police, where he rose to the rank of an Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP). He also had an enviable trajectory of service to his people and Oyo State.” Governor Abiodun said the late politician will be sorely missed, but “our solace lies in the eventful life he lived, the many lives he touched and the legacy of service he left behind.” The “Day of Tributes” featured a public lecture titled “Otunba Christopher Adebayo Alao Akala: The Lifetime of a Humane Politician”, which was delivered by Prof. Tunji Olaopa, while goodwill messages were delivered by notable political leaders from within and outside Oyo State at the well-attended event.
