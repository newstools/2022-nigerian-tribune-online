I have a friend who has HIV and was on medications. When she recently had a blood test, the HIV did not show again and he tested negative. How is this possible? Steven (by E Mail)  It means that the antiretroviral drugs she took did a good job of controlling the infection. Although she’s still technically positive, however, at the time of the test, she had a viral load that’s below the detection threshold. However, this does not mean that her HIV has been cured. She has to continue taking her medications because failure to do so might lead to the rise of the virus and a positive test.
