AS Nigerians grapple with fuel scarcity, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) has disclosed that it distributed a total of 387.59 million litres of Premium Motor Spirit, popularly called petrol, across the country, in one week. As contained in the NNPC weekly national evacuation report released on Wednesday, the corporation, on a daily basis, distributed an average of 55.4million litres of petrol through retail filling stations from February 14-20. The release of 387.59 million litres of petrol is in line with the promise of the NNPC to deliver over 2.3 billion liters of PMS before the end of February. The 2.3 billion litres target had been set following the scarcity created following the withdrawal of methanol-blended petrol from circulation. Owing to the withdrawal of the methanol-blended petrol, fuel queues have resurfaced in the past two weeks with only some filling stations selling petrol.
