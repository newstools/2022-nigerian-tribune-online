If you love me,pray for my family. If you intend to support me, only pray for me. “Don’t send me a dime or consolation message,o don’t do well with that! “But know I appreciate you all a lot and I’m grateful, “ she said. The actress whose mother died in January concluded by saying  that as much as she appreciates the love and support she  is getting, she would love to grieve privately and wouldn’t need anyone around her.
