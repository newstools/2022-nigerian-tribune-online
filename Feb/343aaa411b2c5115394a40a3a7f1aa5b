Whenever two elephants are engaged in a battle, the grasses around them will definitely suffer. The incessant strikes by members of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) and affiliate unions have been causing  students in the country’s tertiary institutions psychological pain and disorders for a long time. Gone are the days when students could calculate and determine the duration of their course of study without fail. These days, things are different. It is a fact that their permutations are absolutely wrong, due to the incessant strikes embarked upon by ASUU, Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (SSANU) and the Non-Academic Staff Union of Universities (NASU). The truth of the matter is that whenever students are forced to vacate campuses, it usually leads to the proliferation of crime in the society at large! Apparently, the educational system in Nigeria is in a state of coma. It is nothing compared to the standard that we had in the past. Nigeria is lagging behind scientifically and technologically on a daily basis as a result of the lackadaisical approach by the government to the education sector. The change that everybody is clamouring for cannot be in place until the youth are given qualitative education. The students are fed up of forceful ejection from their hostels. ASUU and other unions should rethink their methods. They are making students miserable. The people at the helm of affairs should endeavour to urgently work on the Memorandum of Understanding between the unions and the Federal Government in order to curb the menace of the persistent strikes. The strikes do not work in favour of the students; they cause setbacks for them in all ramifications. Rev. Oladimeji Michael Olalekan, Ibadan.
