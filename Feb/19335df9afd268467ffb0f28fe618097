The People’s Democratic Party (PDP), Imo State Chapter has called on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to cancel the Saturday, February 26th House of Assembly bye-election in Ngor Okpala. The party in a statement signed and issued on Sunday by the state chairman, Charlse Ugwu said that the outcome “will only reflect the manipulations of Hope Uzodinma and his band of electoral fraudsters and not the will of Ngor Okpala people.” The party demanded from INEC to order an immediate recount of the materials and votes and reconcile them with the BVAS data while further calling on INEC to direct its HOD Ops Fidelis Uguru to ensure the security and safety of all the materials and data deployed in the Ngor Okpala bye-election. Ugwu said: “This election is seriously compromised in every detail. We reiterate our call for a total cancellation.” The party alleged “massive intimidation of voters in all the booths across the 11 wards of Ngor Okpalla using uniformed policemen attached to the Speaker IMHA and his colleagues who beat up opposition party men and party agents, chased them away and openly engaged in vote-buying and inducement contrary to sections 128 (a&b) of the newly signed Electoral Act.” He said: “these desperate criminal acts are clearly in contravention of the provisions of Sections 25 to 60 of the Electoral Act as amended.”  ORITAMEFA BAPTIST MODEL SCHOOLS, (OBMS), IBADAN
