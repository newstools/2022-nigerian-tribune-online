The Oyo State Commissioner for Education, Science and Technology, Rahman Abiodun Abdul-Raheem, has restated the Oyo State government’s support for girl-child initiatives. The commissioner stated this when the team from Global Youth Leadership & Girl-child Foundation (GYLGF), an NGO, led by its founder, Dr Adepeju Oti, visited him at the Ministry of Education, Oyo State Secretariat, Ibadan, on Thursday. Abdul-Raheem while addressing the team decried the absence of good mentors for young people. This he said had given room for negative mentors who have influenced young people to do bad. He said if children especially the girl-child have good mentors who will take children under their wings, these children will grow up to be morally sound adults who will influence society for good and reverse the moral decadence in the society. He, therefore, pledged the state government’s support for GYLGF’s initiatives which are geared towards helping the girl-child to achieve lofty ambitions through GYLGF’s mentorship programmes and Raising Girls Ambition (RAGA) seminars, among others. ALSO READ FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE Dr Oti said that GYLGF is committed to improving the lot of the girl-child and sought the collaboration of the state government on its initiatives including the Annual RAGA international interdisciplinary conference, debate, quiz and essay competition, RAGA Ambassadors Club in schools to provide leadership training for boys and girls, Global Career Mentorship Programme, career summit and gender sensitisation workshops. The commissioner said the government will collaborate with GYLGF on the above programmes while commending Dr Oti and her team for being consistent over the years in tackling the problems facing the girl-child in society.
