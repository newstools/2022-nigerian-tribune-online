Niger State Government has urged the Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) to fish out illegal and criminal immigrants whose activities have become inimical to the state. Speaking through the State Government on Tuesday in Minna was the Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Ahmed Ibrahim Matane, when he received the new Comptroller of Nigeria Immigration Service, Niger State Command, Nongo Samuel Shima, in his office at the Government House, Minna. Matane further urged the service to help monitor and check the influx of irregular immigrants in the state so as to put a stop to the incessant criminal activities of the irregular migrants and their cohorts in the state. He reiterated the commitment of the state government to collaborate with the NIS in addressing the incessant security challenges in some parts of Niger State. Earlier in his remarks, Shima told the SSG that he was in his office to familiarise himself with the government and people of the state. He applauded the SSG for the warm reception accorded him since his arrival to the state and then commiserated with the government and people of the state over the demise of the former SSG, late Hon Ibrahim Isa Ladan, which took place on Saturday in Abuja after a protracted illness.
