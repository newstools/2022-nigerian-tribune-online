IN CASE YOU MISSED THESE FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE “At the museum we have plants and animals like rabbits, chickens and fish. The waste from these three animals we will use in our creative ‘eco-garden.’ “We also have artworks from notable persons like Ibrahim Gbadamosi, a plastic waste artist; we have works from Babatunde Odunlade, ceramic works and more.” She explained that the Sustainable Development Goals were a key component in the operations of the waste museum. “What we do is partnership for the goals, so we partner with artists that are exploring different forms of art from different forms of waste. “Our focus is waste, and we are here to showcase waste to treasure.” ORITAMEFA BAPTIST MODEL SCHOOLS, (OBMS), IBADAN
