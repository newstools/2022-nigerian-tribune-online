Looking into the week, analysts believed the equities market would sustain its bullish momentum as investors anticipate the release of corporates’ FY 2021 financial statements. “In the short term, we expect the bulls to continue to rotate their portfolio towards dividend-paying stocks ahead of 2021FY dividend declarations, even as institutional investors continue to search for clues on the direction of yields in the FI market. However, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks as the weak macro environment remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings,” analysts at Cowry Assets.
