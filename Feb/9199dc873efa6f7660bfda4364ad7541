 The Governor said in 2021, through the BESDA Program alone, Adamawa State was able to reduce its number of out-of-school children by 51205 from twelve local government areas. He said the government has involved traditional institutions in the crusade based on the belief that the royal fathers have a lot to contribute, not only in the educational sector but also in agriculture, health, and other sectors. The Governor called on all the people of Adamawa to join his administration in dealing with the out-of-school syndrome, which according to him is the only way of ensuring peace and stability in the state and beyond. Lamido Adamawa, Dr Muhammdu Barkindo Aliyu Mustafa represented by Galadima Adamawa, Alhaji Mustafa Aminu saluted Governor Fintiri for transforming the state in the areas of education and infrastructure among others.
