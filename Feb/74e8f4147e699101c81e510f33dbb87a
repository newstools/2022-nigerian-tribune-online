Apex South-South voice of reason, the Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) has lauded President Muhammadu Buhari for assenting to the amended Electoral Bill. PANDEF’s National Publicity Secretary, Hon. Ken Robinson, gave the commendation in a terse statement made available to our correspondent on Friday evening. Recall that President Buhari, after so much suspense and anxiety, eventually signed the amended Electoral Bill into law on Friday. “It is a welcome development after all the dilly-dally. This is, perhaps, the best thing President Muhammadu Buhari has done in terms of strengthening the nation’s democratic process. “President Buhari and the National Assembly both deserve commendation. The ball is now in the court of the Electoral Commission to ensure that the Act is implemented to the letter in the entire electoral process, with adherence to every detail, in all parts of the country,” the body charged.
