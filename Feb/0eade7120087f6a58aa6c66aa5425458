A Federal High Court, Abuja, on Friday, granted the request by a former Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF), Mohammed Adoke, for permission to travel to the United States of America for medical attention. Justice Inyang Ekwo, in a ruling, ordered the release of Adoke’s international passport to enable him process his visa. Justice Ekwo also ordered Adoke to return the passport within three days of his return to the country. Adoke is being tried before the court on money laundering related charge. He is standing trial alongside a businessman, Aliyu Abubakar, the second defendant in the matter. His international passport was deposited with the court registry in partial fulfilment of the conditions attached to the bail earlier granted him. Adoke, in his application dated February 24, said he needed the passport to process his “medical visa for entry into the USA to honour a scheduled medical appointment for lumbar spondylosis at the Spine Institute, Euclid Avenue, Cleveland Hospital, Ohio, USA.” In a motion on notice marked: FHC/ABJ/CR/39/2017, and moved by his lawyer, Kanu Agabi, Adoke sought for the court order “directing the release of his international passport. After counsel for the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Ofem Uket, and lawyer to the second defendant, Emmanuel Olafusi, did not oppose the application, Justice Ekwo granted the prayers. He adjourned the matter till March 7 for trial continuation. ORITAMEFA BAPTIST MODEL SCHOOLS, (OBMS), IBADAN
