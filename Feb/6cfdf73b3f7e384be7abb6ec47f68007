A high court sitting in Abakaliki, Ebonyi State capital on Monday dismissed a suit challenging the defection of Governor Dave Umahi from the Peoples Democratic Party(PDP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC). Chief Sonni Ogbuoji who represented Ebonyi south zone in the Senate between 2015 and 2019, had approached the court seeking Umahi’s removal from office as the governor of the state having dumped PDP and joined APC. Ogbuoji also prayed the court to declare him governor of the state having came second in 2019 the election. Delivering judgment on the suit, the presiding judge, Justice Henry Njoku, stated that the plaintiff came through originating summons. He noted that though the plaintiff did not come through relevant rules of court to institute his originating summons, the court still went ahead in the interest of substantive justice to hear the matter of the propriety of the defection of Umahi from PDP to APC.
