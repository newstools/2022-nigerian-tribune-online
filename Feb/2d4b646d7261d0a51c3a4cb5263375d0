Kano State House of Assembly has rejected a letter received from the office of the state auditor general, over the appointment of Alhaji Isma’il Musa as substantive auditor general. The purported rejection was sequel to a letter read by the Speaker, Alhaji Hamisu Ibrahim Chidari, during the plenary session. The speaker disclosed that after careful deliberations, the House unanimously rejected the substantive appointment due to constitutional infringement while citing section 126 subsection 1 and 2 of the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Meanwhile, the house has called on the state government to as a matter of urgency reconsider its decision on the closure and revocation of Midwifery School Dambatta and other higher institutions of learning due to security reasons. IN CASE YOU MISSED THESE FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE This is following a motion of public importance sponsored by a member representing the Dambatta local government area, Alhaji Murtala Musa Kore, supported by the lawmakers.

In their contributions, members representing Doguwa, Kunchi/Tsanyawa, Wudil and Dala local government areas argued that closure and relocation of some higher institutions of learning in the state have affected students’ performance. The house unanimously adopted the motion and urged the state government to consult security agencies on the possibility of reopening the schools to move education forward.
