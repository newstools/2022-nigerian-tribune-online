Peter Obi,  the Labour Party presidential candidate, and his running mate, Yusuf Datti Baba-Ahmed, on Sunday visited former president, Olusegun Obasanjo, on Sunday. Baba-Ahmed took to his Twitter handle to share pictures from the meeting. The visit may likely be to gather wider acceptance and support for their presidential ambitions. Baba-Ahmed stated: “Earlier today, myself and H. E. #PeterObi in company of other #NgLabour chieftains consulted with the former President, Olusegun Obasanjo.” Baba-Ahmed is the founder of Baze University, Abuja. Senator Datti Baba-Ahmed is a 46-year-old and former senator representing Kaduna North. He became Peter Obi’s running mate after a chieftain of the party and former presidential spokesman, Doyin Okupe, withdrew his interest to contest for the office of vice president, under the platform of the LP.
