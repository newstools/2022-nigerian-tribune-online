As preparations for the July edition of the Healing Streams Live Healing Services with Pastor Chris Oyakhilome hots up, billions of prospective participants at the world largest event have been urged to raise their spirituality in order to fully discover and experience the life changing infinite power of God. Media Manager of the Healing School of Christ Embassy, Mr. Olajide Babasola, who gave the advice said the Healing Streams Live Healing Services will hold from Friday 29th – 31st July while partakers should register to participate in the programme @ www. healingstreams.tv/3days. According to him, “this month’s bumper edition like the previous one, would offer a rare opportunity for participants to experience torrents of God’s healing miracles through Pastor Chris from various diseases. “God’s will is for all men to live in health and to constantly enjoy the blessings of Christ. For many, however, this divine revelation is not yet their reality. They are beaten down daily by sicknesses and diseases, living the opposite of the life God ordained for them. This is why the man of God, Pastor Chris Oyakhilome is reaching billions across the world with the healing power of God through the Healing Streams Live Healing Services,” he said. Quoting Pastor Chris Oyakhilome, the statement added that: “divine healing is one of the beginning stages of a greater life. Healing is wonderful, but there’s a greater life than healing. God doesn’t want you to live in the realm of getting healed from one sickness or the other every now and then. He wants you to come to a place of victory where you understand divine health, which is greater than divine healing.” He further noted that with countless lives transformed all over the globe, the “Healing Streams Live Healing Services with Pastor Chris is truly a place of solution; where people experience God’s love, wisdom and the supernatural manifestations of the healing power of God to a hurting and dying world”
