He said “I congratulate Mr Yakubu Chonoko Maikyau,SAN. The NBA, over the years, has continued to safeguard human rights and promote the Rule of Law. We owe it as a duty not to lose sight of this onerous responsibility. “As a former President of the Bar, I am aware that the people will always look up to you to speak on their behalf. “The Bar has an active role to play in the socio-economic development of the country. We can’t afford to let the people down. “As lawyers, it is important to always prosecute your convictions with courage and be the voice of the people. When you speak, you do so with authority.” The Governor appreciated the NBA for recently naming the Association’s Institutes Building after him and his Professional Mother, Chief Folake Solanke, SAN.
