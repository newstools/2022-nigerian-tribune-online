FORMER Senate President Bukola Saraki has described the recent visit of governors of Ekiti and Ondo states, Dr Kayode Fayemi and Olurotimi Akeredolu, respectively, to their Rivers State counterpart, Nyesom Wike, as an exercise in futility. The two All Progressive Congress governors were said to be in Port Harcourt, Rivers State capital, perhaps, to woo the aggrieved Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), governor to the ruling party. However, speaking with journalists in Ilorin, Senator Saraki said the visit would amount to nothing at the end of the day, adding that PDP would not allow Governor Wike to leave the opposition party. “Governor Wike is an important member of our party and I am very confident that in no distant time we will sit down and address all the issues.

I appreciate that. All our stakeholders appreciate that and Governor Wike himself appreciates that”.  On the current strike by university unions in Nigeria, the ex- governor of Kwara state laid the blame on Federal Government’s insensitivity. “There is no way I will be part of government as the Senate President and ASUU and other unions in the universities will go on strike for months. “It is lack of compassion and dedication. It is a matter that government should lock itself up in a room and not come out until the matter is resolved. And I have not seen that dedication. I don’t know whether you have seen it. “That is the difference between PDP government and what we have now. It could not have happened under Presidents Obasanjo,
