I have been asked to substitute sugar for honey. However, the two taste the same to me. I will like to know if actually honey is better than sugar. Mercy (by SMS)  Apart from having a lower GI value than sugar, meaning that it does not raise blood sugar levels as quickly, honey is sweeter than sugar, so you may need less of it than sugar.
