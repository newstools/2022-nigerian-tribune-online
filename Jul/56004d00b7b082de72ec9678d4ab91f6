President Muhammadu Buhari has told Mohammed Barkindo, the outgoing Secretary-General of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), that his tenure at the cartel witnessed the most challenging time for the oil industry. He said Barkindo happened to serve the body at a time oil producers had difficulties reaching a common position on the challenges facing the market. The president expressed the nation’s gratitude to the former Group General Manager (GMD) of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) when he received him at the Presidential Villa, Abuja on Tuesday, describing him as a worthy ambassador of the country. President Buhari said posterity will remember him kindly for making the nation and himself proud during his six years of meritorious service at the helm of affairs as the 4th OPEC Secretary-General from Nigeria. The president directed the Ministry of Petroleum Resources and the NNPC Limited to mobilise the oil and gas industry to organise a befitting welcome reception in honour of Barkindo. A statement issued by Femi Adesina, Special Adviser to the President (Media & Publicity) quoted the president as telling Barkindo: ‘‘You have indeed been a worthy ambassador of our country. We are proud of your achievements before and during your appointment at OPEC and the proud legacies you will leave behind. ‘‘Your time in charge of the affairs of OPEC has been a very challenging one for the global oil industry. Oil producers were finding it difficult to come together to address challenges that were crippling the oil market. ‘‘Not long after, the world was faced with the COVID-19 pandemic that sent crude prices spiralling down at an alarming rate. You showed incredible leadership to rally industry players and pushed through the turbulent times.

This was a herculean task.” President Buhari further praised the outgoing scribe for providing experienced administrative management to OPEC, adding that his efforts have placed the organization in a stronger position to confront the challenges it will face in the coming years. In his remarks, Barkindo attributed his success to the tremendous guidance, charisma and international gravitas of President Buhari; support from OPEC secretariat in Vienna; and cooperation by members of the organisation. He recounted how the counsel from President Buhari helped in the birthing of the Declaration of Cooperation of OPEC and non-OPEC oil-producing countries, after he assumed office in Vienna, Austria in 2016 during a downturn in the sector when oil prices plunged to less than 10 U.S dollars per barrel. He stated: ‘‘It was very obvious to me that this was beyond OPEC alone to address. We needed to get the support of other leading oil producers around the world. ‘‘I recall that I did consult with you and I drank from your fountain of wisdom and your deep reservoir of knowledge of OPEC and global affairs. ‘‘With your advice and guidance, I set out to various capitals around the world to try to persuade them to understand the gravity of the situation and the need for them to urgently join hands with OPEC. ‘‘I did explain to them that they do not have to be full members of OPEC but we could work together in a framework of cooperation and on the 10th December, 2016 we signed this historic agreement in Vienna and on the 1st January, we started working together and we were able to assist the oil market to restore stability.’’ The former OPEC Secretary-General noted that the Declaration of Cooperation, which is now in its sixth year, also helped the organisation to navigate the turbulence in the market occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. He explained that amidst COVID-19, the organisation took a decision to withdraw 9.6 million barrels per day from the market-the highest ever adjustment in its history- for a duration of two years. He added that OPEC is now in the final lap of restoring the production figures due to a rebound in the global market and economy. Barkindo stressed that ‘‘throughout the period of my tenure I have continued to benefit from the President’s international goodwill and everywhere I visited in the world both within OPEC and outside OPEC, the first person your fellow Presidents, Prime Ministers and Kings, ask me of is; how is my brother, President Muhamamdu Buhari.’’ Having survived the major turbulences in 2016 and 2020, Barkindo expressed confidence that the worst is over and the future looks very promising for the organisation. He, therefore, thanked President Buhari for giving him the opportunity to serve, pledging that Nigeria would continue to play its leadership role in OPEC as well as in the global oil industry.
