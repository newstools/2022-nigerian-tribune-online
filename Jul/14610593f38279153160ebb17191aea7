ALSO READ FROM  NIGERIAN TRIBUNE When contacted, the command’s Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Abimbola Oyeyemi, confirmed the incident but denied knowledge of the death of the student. He said that the security operatives were not chasing a suspected internet fraudster, but a notorious secret cultist, who had for a long time, been on the wanted list of the police. The PPRO explained that residents of the area colluded with the suspected cultists and attempted to prevent the security operatives from performing their lawful duty, hence the need to deploy minimum force to scare away the people.
