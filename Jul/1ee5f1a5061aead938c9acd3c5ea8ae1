NATIONAL chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Abdullahi Adamu, has described the party’s Muslim-Muslim ticket as the work and will of God, saying Christians in the country who are agitated by the choice need not fear. Adamu said he is confident the ruling party will win Saturday’s governorship election in Osun State, as a pointer to its victory in 2023. He stated this on Wednesday when he led the party’s National Working Committee (NWC) on a courtesy visit to President Muhammadu Buhari at his residence in Daura, Katsina State. The former Nasarawa State governor said the visit was to brief President Buhari on what transpired in Osun State on Tuesday during the APC governorship mega rally. According to Adamu, the party went through a rigorous practical assignment on the selection process before arriving at the Muslim-Muslim ticket. He described Kashim Shettima as a Nigerian citizen who does not need to be either Muslim or Christian before being selected as running mate to a presidential candidate. Adamu appreciated Christians for showing interest in the ticket, as he asked citizens to face the realities of the country’s police.
