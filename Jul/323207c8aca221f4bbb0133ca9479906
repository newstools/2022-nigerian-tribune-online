Presidential flag-bearer of the All Progressive Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, has urged the people of Osun State to replicate the victory recorded by the party in last month’s Ekiti State governorship election. Tinubu stated this during the APC mega rally on Tuesday held at the Osogbo Township Stadium in preparation for the July 16th governorship election in the state. According to Tinubu: “We have come to ask that you vote massively on Saturday for APC, not as a mark of entitlement but because of the future of your children. “Before you make your decision, think of the future. We are a party that guarantees your future because we are known for fulfilling our promises. Let us entrust the affairs of our state into the hands of those who mean business, not mushroom parties.” The APC mega rally was held with assurances from 21 APC governors to ensure Governor Gboyega Oyetola’s re-election as the state governor. While addressing the crowd, Senate President, Senator Ahmad Lawan, lauded Oyetola’s prudence and efficiency in managing the state’s meagre resources, calling on citizens to look beyond political sentiments in their choice of who to elect and to vote massively for Oyetola. Lawan said: “I’m bringing solidarity from the National Assembly. We are believers of this party and its candidate because Osun has witnessed a serious and massive transformation in the last three and a half years. “We have a governor who is prudent and efficient in the face of very meagre resources. Today, Osun has witnessed so much infrastructural development, political stability and peace. We believe that we have everything we need for development with this our Governor.” In his remarks, the National Chairman of the party, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, said the mega rally was an indication that the APC was not taking any chances with the affairs of Osun, saying the state deserves a leader like Oyetola in its quest for development. Adamu said: “This is a mega rally to promote our candidate. We are taking no chances with the affairs of Osun because the state deserves a leader like Oyetola in its quest for development. This is why we have come in full strength to support him in a bid to ensure his re-election. Those who have a fair mind will testify that he has done so much since he became governor in 2018. “We are here not only to testify to what he has done but to appeal to you to turn out in large numbers to vote massively for him. We are anticipating a better outcome than what we had in Ekiti and by the grace of God, we are sure of victory. I want you to be the APC ambassadors, telling those who are not here what you have seen. Continue to spread the good works of this government in the nooks and crannies of the state.” Speaking on behalf of his colleagues, Chairman of the Nigeria Progressives Governors’ Forum, Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi State, assured that Oyetola has the backing of all APC governors in the coming election, saying he earned it with his outstanding performance. Bagudu also lauded the tremendous and landmark developments Osun had recorded across sectors since Oyetola’s emergence.  “We are pleased to be here today, we are proud to hear about the numerous progress that this administration in Osun has recorded. We are confident that the love and admiration of the people of Osun are with you because of your great achievements.
