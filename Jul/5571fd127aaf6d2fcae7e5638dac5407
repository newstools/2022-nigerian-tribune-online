Looking ahead, the Company’s Head of Finance, Mr Valentine Onyibo, forecast an easier sail in the years ahead. “I can authoritatively tell you that with this financial result, we have laid a solid foundation for the years ahead. Of course, we have taken the time to engage in some reviews and have identified areas we need to improve upon. We are very optimistic that the first quarter result which is due in a couple of weeks, shall come out stronger and better,” Onyibo said. Red Star has demonstrated impressive resilience, as its many industry peers grapple with harsh operational climate realities arising from the untold impact of COVID-19, high rate of inflation and other macroeconomic pressures.
