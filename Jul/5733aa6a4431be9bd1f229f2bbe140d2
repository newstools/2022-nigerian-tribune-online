According to residents, gunmen numbering about ten fired two gunshots on arrival, which alerted the community’s security vigilantes, adding, however, that the vigilantes had to stay off as the kidnappers aimed at them as they approached. The attackers, the residents said, forced their way into a room within the compound of the traditional ruler, before moving to another one, where they found the chief, where they abducted him without resistance, moving back through an untarred road that leads to Bwari town in the process. At the time of filing this report, the FCT Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Josephine Adeh, was yet to respond to inquiries from Nigerian Tribune about the incident.
