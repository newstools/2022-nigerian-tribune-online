His spokesman, Laolu Akande, confirmed in a tweet on Saturday that the Vice President had gone into a hospital for the procedure. The tweet on his verified handle, @akandeoj, did not give details but said doctors would give the Vice President update on the condition. Akande tweeted: “VP Osinbajo is in the hospital today for a surgical procedure on account of a recurrent pain in the leg possibly sustained from an injury while playing squash. His doctors would give an update of the treatment later today.”
