Ahead of the 2023 general elections, the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court of Nigeria, Justice John Tsoho has issued a new practice direction that would ensure fair, impartial and expeditious determination of pre-election matters. The Assistant Director, Information of the Court, Dr. Catherine Oby Christopher said in a statement that, the Chief Judge issued the new practice direction in the handling of pre-election cases in the  exercise of the power conferred on him by section 254, 285 (9), (10) and (14) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended), Sections 29(5) and 84(14) of the Electoral Act, 2022 (as amended) and all other powers enabling him in that behalf. The new practice direction said, in all election matters, parties should minimize the time spent in dealing with interlocutory matters, ensure that the possibility of settlement is explored before the parties go into hearing and to also minimize undue adjournments and delays in the conduct of matters. The statement said, the practice directions which shall apply to every pre-election matter brought pursuant to the provisions of the Constitution and the Electoral Act, 2022 shall apply notwithstanding the provisions of the Federal High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules, 2019.
