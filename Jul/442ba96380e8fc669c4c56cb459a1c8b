Today’s marriages don’t have many selling points. Rather, many marriages are discouraging to the unmarried. Many spouses are enduring, instead of enjoying the marriage. It’s a situation that calls for serious concern. A lot of abusive acts go on in the marriage, especially both emotional and physical abuse. When you get to hear what many spouses, both male and female endure, you start wondering if getting married is worth the effort. Little wonder many marriages are at various levels of disintegration: silent home treatment, malice, infidelity, physical abuse, and separation; all engendering divorce. This got me thinking, and I decided to examine it for the purpose of securing our marriages against an abuse, either emotional or physical. I have come to realize that the leading cause of abusive acts, emotional or physical, is unfulfilled expectations. A lot of married couples are not getting the expected satisfaction from the marriage setting, thus leading to frustration.  The expectations center around the reasons for getting into the marriage: financial security, companionship, sexual pleasure, and children, among others. These differ from person to person, depending on individual personality. How to secure your marriage against abuse When we put all these into consideration, the incident of abuses in the marriage setting will be in the lowest ebb, if not totally eliminated, becoming the exception, rather than the rule.
