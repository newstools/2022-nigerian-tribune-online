Nigeria’s permanent delegate to UNESCO, Dr Hajo Sanni, and the director-general of Nigerian Tourism Development Corporation (NTDC), Chief Folorunsho Coker, on Sunday said the Ilorin Emirate annual durbar can be used as a springboard to attract foreign investments to Nigeria. Sanni and Coker spoke in Ilorin, Kwara State during the 2022 Ilorin Emirate durbar held at the forecourt of the palace of the Emir of Ilorin, Alhaji Ibrahim Sulu-Gambari. The UNESCO ambassador, who was represented by Dr. Uche Ibe, said the durbar is good enough to attract foreign tourists to Kwara state, who may, in turn, invest in the state because of its serene environment. “UNESCO is convinced that no development can be sustainable without a strong cultural component. “It is my wish to advocate that the solutions we seek to major global challenges lie in our taking full advantage of our cultural heritage. “On this, I challenge our cultural sentinels to do all they can to promote cultural revival.” In her goodwill message, the NTDC DG, who was represented by Mrs Nana Yakubu, thanked the Emir, the organisers and the people of Ilorin Emirate for a beautiful display of culture.

Earlier, the chairman of the Ilorin Emirate Durbar Committee, Engineer Yahaya Alapasanpa, had called on Governor Abdulrazaq to use his influence to attract foreign tourists to the state to witness the durbar programme. This, he said will encourage the tourist to invest in the state, thereby improving the state’s internally generated revenue (IGR). Alapasanpa said the annual event encourages indigenes of the Ilorin Emirate to come home to celebrate with their kith and kin and see where they can contribute to the development of Ilorin and the state at large.
