With the growing rate of previously vaccinated people still coming down with the COVID-19 infection, some keep- fit experts have advocated regular exercises as a way of reducing the incidence of COVID -19 infection. How true is this? Gabriel (by SMS)  Science has confirmed that being physically active helps us feel better, and prevents or slows many diseases, including heart disease, cancer and other forms of ailments. Recently, some experts have added COVID 19 to this group of preventable diseases. The experts observed that being consistently inactive was a stronger risk factor for severe COVID-19 outcomes than any of the underlying issues.  They therefore recommended that in addition to vaccination and following public health safety guidelines such as social distancing and mask use, engaging in regular Physical Activity (PA) may be the single most important action individuals can take to prevent severe COVID-19 and its complications, including death.

According to Ologunagba, about 18,000 Nigerians have been killed by terrorists between 2020 and 2022 “as the criminals continue to be emboldened by the failures and obvious complicity of the APC and to which the PDP had always drawn attention.” “This is not politics; this is about humanity and leadership, which leadership sadly and unfortunately is missing in our country at this time,” he said. The PDP added that it is appalled by “the lame response by the apparently helpless, clueless and deflated Buhari Presidency, wherein it told an agonizing nation that President Buhari “has done all and even more than what was expected of him as Commander in Chief by way of morale, material and equipment support to the military…” “This is a direct admission of incapacity and failure by the Buhari Presidency and the APC. At such a time, in other climes, the President directly leads the charge and takes drastic measures to rescue and protect his citizens. “In time of adversity, the President transmutes into Consoler-in-Chief to give hope and succour to the citizens. Painfully, Nigeria does not have a President who cares and can stand as Consoler-in-Chief to the citizens. “It has now become very imperative for Nigerians to take note and realize that the only solution to this unfortunate situation is to hold the APC government accountable. We must come together as a people, irrespective of our political, ethnic and religious affiliations to resist the fascist-leaning tendencies of the APC administration.  Ologunagba called for an urgent meeting of the National Council of State to advise on the way to go over the nation’s worsening insecurity. “Our nation must not fall. The resilient Nigerian spirit and ‘can-do- attitude’ must be rekindled by all to prevail on the President to immediately and without further delay, accede to the demand by the PDP and other well-meaning Nigerians to convene a special session of the National Council of State to find a lasting solution since the President has, in his own admission, come to his wit’s end,” the PDP spokesman declared.
