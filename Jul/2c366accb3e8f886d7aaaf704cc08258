The choice of a Muslim running mate for the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) does not augur well for national unity and cohesion a Christian coalition has said. The National Christian coalition in a statement issued in Lagos and signed by its convener, Apostle Titi Oluwadare, noted that the choice of former Borno State Governor Kashim Shetima a Muslim as running mate to the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Ahmed Tinubu, also a Muslim has given the two most important political posts in the country to Muslims only thereby denying Christians easy access to the commanding height of governance in this country adding that it would have been better if a Christian had been chosen as APC presidential running mate. The statement added that the best way to promote national unity is to share key political posts in such a way that all ethnic and religious groups are represented at the highest level of governance. The coalition said it deplores a situation where it is gradually becoming the norm that one ethnic group and one religious group is the dominant and preferred group among all other ethnic and religious groups. While calling on all Christians across the country to be law abiding and peaceful the coalition urged them to come out en masse in the 2023 general elections and vote for candidates who believe in equal opportunities for all ethnic and religious groups.
