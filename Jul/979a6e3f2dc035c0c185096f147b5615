The Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) is targeting to reach 296, 800 vulnerable individuals with agricultural seeds and fertilisers for the 2022 rainy season farming in Adamawa, Borno, Sokoto, Taraba and Yobe States. The intervention with funding support from the governments of Canada, Germany, Ireland, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland as well as the European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (ECHO) and the United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), targets 42 400 households across Borno, Adamawa, Yobe, Sokoto and
Taraba states. The Head of FAO Northeast Sub-office, Al Hassan Cisse, who disclosed this in a statement made available to journalists in Abuja yesterday, said the support to the affected populations is anchored on the desire to get them back to sustainable food production for self-sustenance and livelihood restoration. He said the provision of quality farm inputs would improve the productivity of the farmers, contributing to enhancing resilience, food security and nutrition. Cisse said the inputs distributed will assist households to mitigate the scourging food insecurity while at the same time contributing to building the resilience of host communities and returnees.
