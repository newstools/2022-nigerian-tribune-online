The CEO, Wyoming Capital & Partners, MrTajudeenOlayinka noted that improved liquidity in the system in the last six months responsible for the positive performance of Nigerian stock market.  Other factors driving liquidity in the equities market he added are, “instant payment of dividends to shareholders through electronic means (e-dividend), provides opportunities for immediate reinvestment of these dividends, especially by institutional investors, who manage funds and portfolios for clients. This did not leave out other traditional investors, who took advantage of low prices, in the run-up to financial year-end rallies that we saw at the beginning of year 2022. “Negative real return in the fixed income market and the need to hedge against inflation. Equity market is an inflation adjusting market, and so, some investors who were willing to hedge against inflation, irrespective of the downside risk that the market poses, decided to bring liquidity back to equity market. “The ongoing crash in the crypto market brought liquidity back to equity market. It has been said that more Nigerian investors participate actively in the crypto space, and so, the sudden, though long expected crash in that market, made some affected Nigerian investors cut their losses, for less volatile and recoverable opportunities in the equity market. “Availability of derivative products is encouraging more institutional investors to embrace equity market. Investors can now short or long the market at ease. All these activities provide liquidity to the market.”
