Hundreds of workers under the auspices of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), in Oyo State, on Tuesday, staged a rally in solidarity with the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) demanding an end to the ASUU’s five-month-old strike. The rally saw workers and members of various trade unions, activist groups move from the NLC State Secretariat to the State Secretariat, Ibadan, where they where addressed by the state deputy governor, Mr Bayo Lawal. Led by the Chairman, Oyo NLC, Mr Martins Kayode, the workers bemoaned the failure of the government to honour agreements entered into with the unions, particularly pointing to the protracted crisis over the Integrated Personnel Payroll System (IPPIS). The union expressed its dismay at the federal government’s reluctance to take necessary steps that will lead to the peaceful resolution of the issues in dispute and end the strike. It called on the Federal Government to end the strike by immediately paying the withheld salaries of university staff, shelve IPPIS, honour the agreements entered and establish a framework for repositioning our universities for competitive service delivery.
