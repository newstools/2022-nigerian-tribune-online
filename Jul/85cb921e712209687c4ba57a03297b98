Equities trading at the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) was bearish on Tuesday, extending its negative tempo into the second trading session of the week, as losses recorded by such high cap stocks as MTN Nigerian, Flour Mills of Nigeria, Zenith Bank and Guaranty Trust Holding Company push the equities market below 51,000 basis points. Thus, the All Share Index (ASI) dipped by 186 basis points (boss) to settle at 50.442.37 bps as against its previous close of 51,400.53 bps. The negative outing pegged both the month-to-date and year-to-date performance of the ASI at -2.65 per cent and 18.09 per cent from their previous close of 0.80 per cent and 21.33 per cent respectively. Equities investors, therefore, lost N516 billion from their networth as the market capitalisation followed suit the direction of the ASI to stand at N27.202 trillion, representing a 1.86 per cent decrease from the N27.718 trillion it stood at the end of the previous trading session.

From the rear of the chart, Trans Express, international Breweries, MTN Nigeria, PZ and Berger Paints populated the top five losers’ chart.
