Kogi State governor, Yahaya Bello, has felicitated Muslim faithful all across the globe and particularly in Kogi State on the occasion of the 2022 Eid-el Kabir celebration, while he used the medium to call for collective sacrifices toward the nation’s interest. He added that leaders at the helms of affairs and citizens must begin to put aside individual interests in a bid to ensure that our country reaches the pinnacle of development where it belongs. Governor Bello stated this in a special Eid-el Kabir commemoration message which was signed on Friday by his Chief Press Secretary, Muhammed Onogwu.

He added that Muslims aside from exemplifying a life of sacrifice and submission just like Prophet Ibrahim did, should as well extend their arm of benevolence and kindness to their neighbours, irrespective of their tribe or religion. Governor Bello stressed that while it has become common knowledge that in Kogi state, citizens have been implored to close the gaps of differences, seasons like this enable individuals to put to practice many of these attributes. While assuring their safety throughout and after the festivities, he cautioned citizens to be vigilant while they celebrate as they take personal responsibility to report any suspicious activity or person to security agencies adding that they themselves must be responsible in their celebration of the joyous season.
