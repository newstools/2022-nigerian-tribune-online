Aare Onakakanfo of Yoruba land, Iba Gani Adams, has described the death of the late Aseyin of Iseyin, Oba Abdul-Ganiyu Adekunle Salawudeen (Oloogunebi Ajinese 1), as a colossal loss, saying Yoruba has lost one of its illustrious sons. Adams said this on Monday in a statement by his Special Assistant on Media, Mr Kehinde Aderemi, as he mourned the passing of the first-class monarch who died, aged 62, adding that his death had robbed Yoruba land of another illustrious son. The Yoruba generalissimo, while condoling with the Oyo State governor, Seyi Makinde, and the people of Iseyin, sadly noted that the passing of the monarch was one death too many for the state in particular and Yoruba land in general, recalling that Oyo State had lost four of its foremost monarchs in the last seven months. “When you consider the rate at which we lose our traditional rulers, particularly, in Oyo State in the last seven months, you begin to wonder why and how this had negatively affected Yoruba land and the traditional institution across South-West.

Iba Adams prayed to God to give the family, and the people of Iseyin the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss, urging the grieving queens of the late monarch to take solace in the fact that though Kabiesi’s journey in life was a bit short, but actually lived a worthy life.
