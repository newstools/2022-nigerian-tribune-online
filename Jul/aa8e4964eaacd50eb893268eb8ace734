She said: “I will like to let you know that this is another first from UBA, and of course, we are very excited at this because it again goes to show that we take very seriously the mandate of ensuring financial inclusion and this time, we are catching them young and ensuring that as they grow they increasingly become financially disciplined and can fuel their dreams to a happy end, which is exactly what we are passionate about as a bank.” Continuing, she said: “We know that the kids today are the future of tomorrow, and we are trying to groom them to imbibe the habit of savings, so that they can achieve their dreams as well as secure their future while putting away something for the future.” Also speaking during the event, Head of Marketing, Diana Ubah, pointed out that, “our bank, UBA, has continued to show and prove that, we are passionate about the overall growth and success of every customer and that is why we go ahead of others to innovate and come out with initiatives that are unique and can transform the lives of our customers for good.” Osun Husband Killer Commits Suicide  UBA commits to securing future of kids and teens Essential Documents You Need When Applying To Study Abroad On Scholarship UBA commits to securing future of kids and teens 100% Natural Solution To Finally End Premature Ejaculation, IncreasesSmall Cucumber and Bedtime Lasting Power in 7days...
