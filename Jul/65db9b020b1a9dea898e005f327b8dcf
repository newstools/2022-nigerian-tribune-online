After about half a kilometer of intense trekking and dragging, they gave him more beating because he was resisting following them so he passed out (fainted). “They left him and went away thinking he was dead. When he regained consciousness, he went home in a pool of blood. His fellow priests who were hiding at the sound of the sporadic shooting around their house came out from their hide-out and rushed him to Igbinedion Teaching Hospital, Okada.  “Today, Monday, 4th July, 2022, he was taken to another hospital to continue treatment. We thank God that he is responding to treatment. Let us pray that God will grant him faster healing.”
