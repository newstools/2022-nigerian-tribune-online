As a leader, you can do a million things correctly to win the respect of your team. But if you fail to do what is right, even when it’s incredibly difficult, it can cost you that respect. It’s more popular to discuss and encourage the positive characteristics of leadership. We don’t often want to focus on the tough choices that leaders must make. As a career and professional development coach, I’ve seen that one of the most overlooked critical skills to ensure lasting leadership is making hard decisions with grace and professionalism. There are tons of positive aspects to being a leader: supporting teams, nurturing growth, coaching others through critical thinking, motivating teams toward a goal and so much more. On the flip side, there is a deep accountability that comes with leadership, and that accountability often comes with making hard choices.  Handling toxic team members You do not always get to pick your team. Perhaps you inherited your department or you rose through the ranks. Regardless, effective team leadership demands you to handle toxic situations quickly, succinctly and thoroughly. Once you realize you have a toxic team environment on your hands, time is of the essence. Rarely do these types of issues resolve themselves.  Tough decisions make great leaders  The ability to follow through on a logical plan and make tough decisions defines leadership excellence. If you struggle to confront others about behavioral challenges or performance issues it will hurt your credibility as a leader and as a competent professional. Not every decision you make will be a popular one. In my experience, doing what is easy is rarely equal to doing what is right and making the best decisions for the health of your team.
