AN aircraft belonging to Caverton Aviation Cameroon, a subsidiary of Caverton Offshore Support Group based in Lagos, Nigeria crashed in Yaounde, Cameroon on Thursday, killing the 11 people on board. The ill-fated plane, which was piloted by the daughter of a former Minister of State, Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Senator Solomon Ewuga, Adzuayi Ewuga, was said to have crashed due to bad weather. The aircraft was flying from Yaounde Nsimalen Airport to Belabo, in the east of the country when air traffic services lost radio contact with it. Majority of the victims were said to be Nigerians. This is just as Nigeria’s Accident Investigation Bureau (AIB) said investigation into the accident was the responsibility of the Cameroonian aviation authorities. Speaking with the Nigerian Tribune on the phone, spokesperson for AIB, Mr Tunji Oketumbi, said though the victims were mainly Nigerians, since the crash happened in Cameroon and coupled with the fact that the ill-fated plane was not registered in Nigeria, the AIB could not dabble into it.
