Former governor of Anambra State, Mr Peter Obi, on Friday, formally announced that he has joined the Labour Party after resigning his membership of the Peoples Democratic Party. Obi announced on his Twitter handle that he had decided to join the party which he described as a route  he considers to be in line with his aspirations and my mantra of taking the country from consumption to production. According to his tweets: “I thank all Nigerians, especially our youths who have joined me in the mission of taking back and reuniting Nigeria. This project is yours and for the future of your children. I am just a facilitator. “Since I resigned from the PDP because of issues that are at variance with my persona and principles, I have consulted widely with various parties and personalities to ensure we do not complicate the route to our desired destination. “For me, the process of achieving our goal is as fundamental as what one will do thereafter. “Therefore, I have chosen a route that I consider to be in line with our aspirations and my mantra of taking the country from consumption to production; and that is the Labour Party which is synonymous with the people, workers, development, production, securing  and uniting Nigerians as one family.  “I invite all Nigerians to join me in taking back our country. Be assured that I’ll never let you down.” HOW TO START AN ONLINE BUSINESS WITH NO MONEY MONEY MAKING OPPORTUNITY- We will pay you in naira or dollars(whichever you prefer) directly to your designated bank account as you will earn  from one or variety of businesses we invest in, ranging from Real estate, Agriculture, Transportation, Construction, Metals, Crude oil, Aviation, Hospitality etc. Click here for full details
