Genevieve, the first actor to win the Africa Movie Academy Award in a leading role in 2005 had over 8.5 million followers on Instagram. One Dr Penking on his Twitter handle @drpenking said that it was unusual, adding that “someone should please check on her. No one is above mental breakdown.” Also, Mr Francis Awuche, a resident, called on the Actors Guild of Nigeria (AGN) to reach out to Genevieve to know her situation.

Reacting to the development, the President of the AGN, Emeka Rolland, told NAN that he was not aware of Genevieve’s exit on Instagram. “Maybe I will have to reach out to her since I am just getting this news from you now. I have not learnt of that. “I will reach out to her to know whether she’s safe or not after your call. I cannot just conclude with hearsay or rumour,” he said.
