Just imagine, we celebrated Easter last week, now the Muslim faithful are celebrating the Eid-el-Fitr and the celebration is going to be done at the same time nationwide. It is a symbol of unity for the country. “Nigerians should not lose hope. Countries like Ghana and our other neighbours were in our present condition, but today the marathon has changed for the best. Nigeria will rise again and shine as the pride of Africa. What will make it happen is prayer, love and unity as the general elections are fast approaching. “I am appealing for prayers from our religious leaders. I am also calling on the politicians to play the game according to the rules and our security forces should be on red alert to deliver free and fair election for a stable nation.”
