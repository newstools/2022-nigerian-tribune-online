The Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Lieutenant General Faruk Yahaya has felicitated  troops of the Nigerian Army (NA) on the occasion of this year’s Eid-El-Fitr Celebration and directed them to eliminate as many bandits, kidnappers and terrorists as possible, and recover as much weapons and ammunition from criminal elements. This was contained in a statement made available to news men in Abuja by the Director of Nigerian Army Public Relations, Brig. Gen Ben Nwachukwu. According to the statement, in the goodwill message to personnel across all Nigeeian Army formations and units, the COAS specially acknowledged and appreciated their sacrifices and commitment in various ongoing operations nationwide. The COAS urged officers and soldiers to leverage on the holy season of Ramadan to reflect on the significance of loyalty, obedience and sacrifice, stressing that the season provides a unique opportunity to re-examine and re-adjust efforts towards fulfilling their constitutional roles, in order to justify the confidence reposed in them by Nigerians. The Army Chief charged field commanders to redouble their efforts in ongoing operations, adding that the best Sallah gift he expected from them was to eliminate as many bandits, kidnappers and terrorists as possible, and recover as much weapons and ammunition from criminal elements. Gen Yahaya paid special tributes to officers and soldiers who paid the supreme price in the defence of fatherland.  He emphasized that under his watch training and welfare of personnel and their families would continue to receive paramount attention.
