Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr Chris Ngige, on Friday, announced his withdrawal from the presidential race in 2023. His announcement followed a valedictory session held at the Council Chamber of the Presidential Villa in the nation’s capital in honour of ministers seeking elective offices in the 2023 general elections. In a statement he wrote on Friday shortly after the meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari, Ngige said he took the decision after consulting with his family, constituents and well-wishers while he added that he had communicated his decision to President Muhammadu Buhari. According to him: “Today, May 13, I had an audience with President Muhammadu Buhari as a follow-up to the one I earlier had with him on 11th May 2022. “Having also consulted with my family, constituents, and well-wishers, it is my pleasure to announce the withdrawal of my interest and earlier decision to contest the office of the president in the 2023 general election.” YOU SHOULD NOT MISS THESE HEADLINES FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE  We Have Not Had Water Supply In Months ― Abeokuta Residents In spite of the huge investment in the water sector by the government and international organisations, water scarcity has grown to become a perennial nightmare for residents of Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital.
