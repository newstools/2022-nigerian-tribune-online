This was disclosed by a resident, Hamza Jere, in an interview with newsmen on Saturday. According to him, the hoodlums stormed the community on Friday night on motorcycles and moved from house to house. Jere noted that “it seems that the bandits had a mindset of who they wanted to abduct. They targeted the home of a former Commissioner, Abdulrahman Ibrahim Jere who was out of town at the time of the attack.” According to him, the bandits attacked the home of a newly-wedded couple, adding that while the husband was trying to resist the kidnapping of his wife they killed him. He added that: “They abducted his wife, a baby girl, his younger sister and his wife’s sister.”  IN CASE YOU MISSED THESE FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE As at the time of filing the report, it was gathered that tension is brewing in the community as youths were said to be expressing their anger over the failure of the security agencies to arrive the scene in time.
