Equities investors, therefore, gained N596 billion as the market capitalization, having crossed N29 trillion market, ended the week at N29.16 trillion as against an opening of N28.562 trillion to N29.158 trillion Notably, the positive performance last week was buoyed by foreign investors’ renewed interest in Airtel Africa, spiking a whopping 20.2 per cent weekly growth.
