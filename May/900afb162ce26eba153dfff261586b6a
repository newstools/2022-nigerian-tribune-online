The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) said, the ongoing investigation of a billionaire drug baron, Chief Afam Mallinson Ukatu, has led to the discovery of how the suspect imported into Nigeria, in a single month, October 2019, two containers containing 1,284 cartons of Tramadol with market value of over N22 billion. The Agency stated this in a statement on Tuesday, to counter insinuations by some hirelings that NDLEA has no evidence to pin a crime on Ukatu, who is the Chairman/CEO of Mallinson Group of companies. After months of surveillance, the NDLEA spokesman, Femi Babafemi said, Ukatu was eventually arrested on board a flight to Abuja at the Lagos airport on 13th April, 2022. Investigations reveal that, he is a major importer of large consignments of different brands and high dosages of Tramadol Hydrochloride, ranging from 120mg, 200mg, 225mg and 250mg, all of which are illicit. Ukatu owns pharmaceutical and plastic manufacturing companies, which he used as a cover to import illicit drugs into Nigeria. The Agency said in the course of investigating the N3 billion Tramadol saga between Ukatu and the Abba Kyari’s IRT team, its operatives have unearthed more evidences establishing how Ukatu has been importing large quantities of Tramadol far above the approved threshold allowed into the country.  In one instance, Ukatu through his Mallinson Group of companies imported into the country two-conatiner loads of five different brands of Tramadol in October 2019 through the Apapa ports in Lagos. All the evidences so far gathered show that the imported Tramadol brands were far above the threshold permitted to be imported into Nigeria. Babafemi said in the statement that the suspect will soon be charged to court.
