The British High Commission has debunked reports circulating in the media and online that the UK Government has added the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) to the UK’s list of terrorist groups or organisations banned under UK law.  These reports are untrue, it declared. In a statement sent to Nigerian Tribune, the British High Commission in Abuja stated that: “We are aware of inaccurate reporting circulating in the media and online that the UK Government has added the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) to the UK’s list of terrorist groups or organisations banned under UK law.  These reports are untrue.  The “Indigenous People of Biafra” (IPOB) is not a proscribed organisation in the UK.” The British High Commission explained that the inaccurate reporting relates to the April 13, 2022 publication by the UK Government of a revised Country Policy and Information note (CPIN) on separatist groups in South-East Nigeria, including IPOB.
