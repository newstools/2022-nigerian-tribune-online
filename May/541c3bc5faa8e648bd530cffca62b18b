At least, three persons lost their lives in Anambra State in two communities in what was said to be a violation of the Monday sit-at-home exercise. Tribune Online gathered that the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) had months back announced every Monday to be a day to sit at home, in protest to the extraordinary rendition of its leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, from Kenya last year. The exercise registered huge compliance, mostly as a result of fear, as residents feared being attacked by members of the group, but it later called off the exercise, but some unidentified persons wielding guns have continued to enforce compliance to the exercise. One person was shot dead in Utuh, Nnewi South Local Government Area, two others were shot dead at Ozubulu, Ekwusigo Local Government Area.
