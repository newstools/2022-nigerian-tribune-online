As a way of encouraging students of the institution, authorities of the Lagos State University (LASU) said, on Monday, that any student who scores 4.5 Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) and above will have a refund of 50 per cent of their school fees. The CGPA is what is used to compute the results of students from part one to the final year and the maximum a student can attain in any institution is 5.0. However, the Vice-Chancellor of LASU, Professor Mrs Ibijoke Olatunji-Bello, who announced this in a statement posted on the Twitter handle of LASU on Monday, said the police will take effect at the end of this academic session. She gave the hint just as the students of the institution began the second-semester examination in the institution. The second semester is popularly known as the rain semester.
