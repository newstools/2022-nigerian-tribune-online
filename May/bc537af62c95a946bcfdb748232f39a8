All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship aspirant in Oyo State and Senator representing Oyo North, Dr Abdulfatai Buhari, has called for collaborative efforts between the employees and employers of labour to produce a developmental workforce in the country. Dr Buhari stated this in a press release issued to commemorate Nigerian workers, particularly those in Oyo State as they joined their colleagues across the world in marking International Workers Day 2022. According to the lawmaker, it is not news that Nigerian labour requires better treatment from employers of labour and so efforts should be geared towards producing a productive workforce in the country. He said if a country must develop, the labour must be encouraged and taken care of to give in their best and contribute genuinely towards the uplift of the nation.

He added, “I rejoice with my people, the labour in Oyo North, Oyo State and Nigeria in general while I pray that they shall celebrate numerous of it on the Earth surface and shall all reap the fruits of their labour.”
