The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA), on Tuesday, warned schools within the territory to stop collaborating with Parents Teachers Association (PTA) to extort money from pupils and students through unapproved projects. FCTA said it was unlawful for schools to hide under special projects to impose heavy burdens on parents and guardians by collecting illegal fees. FCTA Secretary for Education Secretariat, Dahir El-Katuzu, disclosed this during school resumption inspection at Government Secondary School, Kubwa. El-Katuzu sternly warned that any school that violates the rules would be sanctioned, as FCTA has a standard that must be upheld in all schools. The secretary noted that school resumption inspection had been sustained by the secretariat, as a measure to keep both teachers, pupils and students in proper check.
