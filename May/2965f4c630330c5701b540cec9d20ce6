Now again we are going towards a crisis in 2022. One of the reasons I am here is to appeal for your unity ahead of the poll so that you can win no matter the grievances. “You can see what disunity cost in the last election and we lost it. Don’t let us repeat the same mistake, I beg of you the leaders and chieftains of the party. This election is the stepping stone to the general election and it is very key. “I make this appeal to you the caretaker chairman. I want to also urge you to support me in the forthcoming primary election and general election. “I have the right experience to tackle the Nigeria challenges of insecurity and disunity. When our administration led by Olusegun Obasanjo came in, we had similar challenges and we are able to solve it.”
