Elders and traditional rulers of Ukwa Ngwa land have been told to honour an alleged agreement they entered into with Abia North senatorial zone to support power shift to Abia North come 2023. The Abia North stakeholders handed down this advice over the weekend as a governorship aspirant and Deputy Governor of Abia State, Sir Ude Oko Chukwu, met with PDP delegates in Umunneochi, Isuikwuato and Bende Council areas. This call was following the agitation over which zone produces the next governor of Abia State in 2023. The zone explained that no Ukwa Ngwa elder or monarch has denied the agreement they made with the people of Abia North and tasked them to ensure that the agreement to rotate power to Abia North is implemented as 2023 approaches. Led by a former Commissioner of Housing, James Okpara, the Abia North people disclosed that the elders and traditional rulers of Ukwa Ngwa had met with their Abia North on March 5, 2019, at Uturu in Isuikwuato council area, “where they pleaded for the people North of Abia to support Governor Okezie Ikpeazu’s re-election in 2019 while Abia North will be supported to produce Ikpeazu’s successor in 2023.” They said that one of the Ukwa Ngwa elders, Dr Gershon Amuta, has recently acknowledged that there was an agreement between the Ukwa Ngwa elders and their Abia North counterparts.  “A meeting took place on March 5, 2019. The elders of Ukwa Ngwa land met us at the residence of Prof. Gregory Ibe in Uturu, Isuikwuato LGA.

He further tasked the party delegates to support his ambition and promised to prioritise the welfare of the people of the state as well as PDP faithful, if voted into power. “We need to elect a governor who knows the party. I have been in party business for 19 years and I’m best positioned to improve the welfare of party people because I’m a party man. “I have served the party well. I have the experience to turn things around. So, we must be careful who we vote as delegates. It is beyond the issue of he is my brother or he is from my place,” he said.
