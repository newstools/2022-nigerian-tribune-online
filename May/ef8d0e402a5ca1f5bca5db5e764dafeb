Giving the assurance in Lagos, at a media briefing designed to announce the agency’s decision to regulate digital advertising, targeting the Nigerian market, Fadolapo stated that political campaigns would not be given preferential treatment, adding that  same regulatory measures would be applied to ensure they comply with the nation’s advertising rules. According to him, any campaign materials that failed to comply with  laid down rules of decency, honesty and others would not be allowed to be exposed to the public. “Let me assure you all that the agency is more than ready to ensure that political campaigns comply with the rules guiding advertising practice. Any political material that fails to comply with the rules will not be allowed to be exposed. “Interestingly, politicians are aware, and some of them have already started submitting their materials for vetting,” he added.
