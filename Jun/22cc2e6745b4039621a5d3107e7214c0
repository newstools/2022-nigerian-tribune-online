There were four (4) new positive cases in Epi week 23, 2022 from four (4) states – Lagos (1), Delta (1), Oyo (1) and Nasarawa (1).” The World Health Organisation (WHO), on Wednesday, said it is looking into reports that the monkeypox virus is present in the semen of patients, exploring the possibility that the disease could be sexually transmitted. Catherine Smallwood, monkeypox incident manager at WHO/Europe, said it was not known whether recent reports meant the monkeypox virus could be sexually transmitted. “This may have been something that we were unaware of in this disease before,” she told a press briefing. “We really need to focus on the most frequent mode of transmission and we clearly see that to be associated with skin-to-skin contact.” More than 1,300 cases of the viral disease have been reported by about 30 countries since early May. Most cases have been reported in men who have sex with men and the agency reiterated that the virus is mainly transmitted via close interpersonal contact.
