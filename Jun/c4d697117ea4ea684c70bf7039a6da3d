Microsoft is ending support for Internet Explorer retiring its aging web browser after nearly 27 years. The moment comes more than a year after the company said that its Internet Explorer 11 Windows 10 desktop app would be retired in favor of Microsoft Edge. “Not only is Microsoft Edge a faster, more secure and more modern browsing experience than Internet Explorer, but it is also able to address a key concern: compatibility for older, legacy websites and applications,” Microsoft said of its newer browser, which launched in 2015, in a blog post. The first version of Internet Explorer was included in a Windows 95 Plus upgrade pack in 1995. It was once the most popular web browser, reportedly having 95% of the market in 2003. Usage dropped as rivals like Google Chrome rose and Microsoft made the Chromium-powered Edge its default browse. StatCounter indicated it’s recently held around 0.5% of the market.

It can’t have a president because every affiliate organization under this coalition arrangement has its president.  “So, the idea of arrogating to oneself the sensitive position of a president of the coalition is not only being acting as an impostor, but it is also being at variance with the inherent ideology of the Yoruba diaspora organisation,” he said.
