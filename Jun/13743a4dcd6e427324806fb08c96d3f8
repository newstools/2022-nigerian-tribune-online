There was confusion at the All Progressives Congress (APC) National Secretariat on Monday as news filtered that the National Chairman of the party, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, has announced Senate President, Ahmad Lawan as the consensus presidential candidate. Lawan’s disclosure to members of his National Working Committee was on the heels of a meeting between President Muhammadu Buhari and certain governors from the North who restated their weekend resolution on power shift to the South. A member of the APC NWC who craved not to be named, however, said Senator Adamu’s pronouncement was received with mixed feelings. “He (Adamu) said that was the decision of President Buhari. He just made a mere announcement but that wasn’t NWC’s decision.” YOU SHOULD NOT MISS THESE HEADLINES FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE We Have Not Had Water Supply In Months ― Abeokuta Residents  In spite of the huge investment in the water sector by the government and international organisations, water scarcity has grown to become a perennial nightmare for residents of Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital.
