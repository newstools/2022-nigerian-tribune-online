BARRING last-minute changes, Rivers State governor, Nyesom Wike, is set to be named the running mate to the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, after garnering highest votes from the committee responsible to make the final choice. The 17-member committee, led by the national chairman of the opposition party, Dr Iyorchia Ayu, voted overwhelmingly at its meeting in Abuja on Tuesday in favour of the first runners-up in the just-concluded presidential primary of the party. The vote, which was to determine who between him and his Delta and Akwa Ibom states colleagues, Ifeanyi Okowa and Udom Emmanuel, respectively, should be nominated, saw him garner more votes. Nigerian Tribune had previously reported that barring any unforeseen developments, Wike would be named as the running mate to Atiku. ALSO READ FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE It was learnt authoritatively that the former vice president had offered the position to the governor against the backdrop of the political and economic capitals he could attract to the ticket.  Findings indicated that Atiku, who was also the candidate of the PDP in the 2019 exercise, would have since announced the Rivers State governor as his running mate but for the opposition to the idea by some other governors. Governors Sam Ortom (Benue), Seyi Makinde (Oyo) and Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi (Enugu) had spearheaded the efforts to smoothen the way for Wike, following the objection raised by some of their colleagues. After consultations with relevant party stakeholders, Atiku and the PDP hierarchy resolved to set up a committee to make a final recommendation on the issue. Tuesday’s meeting chaired by Ayu was attended by the chairman of the PDP Governors’ Forum and Sokoto State governor, Aminu Tambuwal; Governor Ortom; former Ondo State governor, Segun Mimiko; former president of the Senate, Adolphus Wabara; former Cross River State governor, Liyel Imoke; some members of the PDP National Working Committee (NWC) and other party stakeholders.
