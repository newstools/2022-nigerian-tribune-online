What can justify the N100m All Progressives Congress (APC) expression of interest forms?  It will be a daunting exercise to decipher this. Any attempt to justify this outrageous levy will amount to trying to make the senseless make sense in a country carrying the stigma of being the world’s poverty capital. Nigeria is on a highly explosive trajectory with no end in sight to the immodest claims of corrupt politicians still in the race for elective offices. Caution has been thrown to the winds in a stance that screams of “Who will dare us? We have the money to buy our way through.” Will it not amount to an exercise in facility if one casts his or her vote to any candidate in the major parties? The leadership failure in Nigeria is the outcome of over 60 years of wrong choices made by the electorate; the blindfolded, manipulated poor citizens held captive by poverty and trapped in the traditional structures built by money-bags and godfathers in electing those who will rule Nigeria. It is a process repeated at every election cycle. This sums up the issue of the leadership failure in Nigeria. It is a twin problem- leadership and followership. The politicking going on now does not add up at all. It doesn’t make sense to expect a change when we continue to do the same thing, recycling the old and corrupt politicians. Nigeria will remain crippled by failure of leadership. When we restructure, some semblance of peace returns. This recourse might save Nigeria from the grip of underdevelopment, mass poverty in the midst of massive wealth. If we fail to restructure, then we should expect that further ramp-up still lies ahead. What we are witnessing now will be a foretaste of far worse things to come. Any step that does not lead to restructuring now will only lead to further darkness and confusion as we are experiencing now in the polity. John R. Jimoh Ogun State.
