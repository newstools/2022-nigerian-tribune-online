The seven local government areas under the district are Giwa, Birnin Gwari, lgabi, Kaduna North, Kaduna South, Chikun and Kajuru local governments Muhammad Sani Dattijo who was represented by a close associate and stalwart of the party in the state, Alhaji Ahmed Maiyaki, said “the gesture is to encourage our local farmers across our Constituency to enhance food production and food security and ultimately reduce poverty among our people in line with the manifesto of our great party.” While calling on the committee saddled with the responsibility of distributing the fertilizer to ensure that only deserving local farmers benefit from the gesture, Dattijo also urged the good people of Kaduna Central and indeed the entire state to continue to support the All Progressive Congress (APC) as the party is working assiduously to reconcile and unite all party members ahead of the forthcoming 2023 polls.
