Minister of the Federal Capital Capital (FCT), Mallam Muhammad Musa Bello, has described the maiden interactive Policy dialogue on the Future of Fulani Pastoralists in Nigeria, as a laudable initiative towards enduring peaceful co-existence, security of lives and property as well as unity and development of the country. Bello also noted that the interactive dialogue organised by the Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore, a Fulani Socio-Cultural Association in Abuja, on Thursday, was timely, as it aims at finding lasting solutions to the challenges of herders and pastoralists clashes in some parts of Nigeria and the sub-Saharan region of Africa. The Minister, in his remarks delivered by the Mandate Secretary, FCT Agricultural and Rural Development Secretariat (ARDS), Mallam Ibrahim Abubakar, commended the organisers for convening the dialogue, which attracted participants from outside Abuja and beyond Nigeria’s boundaries to be at the event.
