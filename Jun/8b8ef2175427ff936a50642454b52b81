We will invite inter-faith institutions to come and intervene.  “We are hoping that at the end of the program in September, all the victims would have returned home to restart their lives gradually because giving people food is not sustainable but if they are able to return to their community and farm, we would have set a system for their economic survival,” Mrs Ogunsiji stated.
