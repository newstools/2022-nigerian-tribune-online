The embattled Deputy Governor of Oyo State, Engr Rauf Olaniyan, has approached the state High Court to stall the impeachment process instituted by the State House of Assembly. It will be recalled that 24 out of the 32 members of the State House of Assembly had in a petition accused the deputy governor of “gross misconduct, abuse of office, financial recklessness, abandonment of office, official duty, insubordination and other offences.” The petition read: “This process, according to petitioners, is in accordance with the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as amended in 2011. Section 188.” The deputy governor, as reliably informed, has responded to all the allegations raised in the petition through his legal counsel.
