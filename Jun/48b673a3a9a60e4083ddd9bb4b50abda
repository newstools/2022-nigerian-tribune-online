That is why we decided to do this, too.” Retired Archibishop of the Methodist Church Nigeria, The Most Reverend Ayo Ladigbolu, on behalf of Oyo Town, who was appreciative of the free medical and surgical service, said “this is about your determination to render service to our population, with all our expertise and through your members.
