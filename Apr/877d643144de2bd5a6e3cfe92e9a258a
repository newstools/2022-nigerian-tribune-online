An aspirant for the Ibadan North East/South East federal constituency, on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Dr Adejoke Adekanmbi-Akinseye, has tasked political parties and public office holders on women inclusion and recognition. For too many years, Adekanmbi-Akinseye bemoaned that women continue to be sidelined in politics, decision making, public administration, at all levels of government. With activities towards the 2023 general election ongoing, she pointed out that poor representation of women in governance continues to be the bane of the transformation of the nation that Nigerians yearn for. Describing women as natural nurturers, intelligent and full of potential, she said the nation will be better for it if women are more involved in the running of the nation’s affairs.

Adekanmbi-Akinseye lauded campaigns for legislation that will engender better women representation in politics and governance. She said: “Kudos to those pushing for better women representation. The time is now for women to be recognised. Women have been sidetracked for many years in politics, decision making, and administration. “If women are given a chance, this nation will be transformed beyond what we can even think, Women are natural nurturers, intelligent, full of potential and you see them in the informal sector excelling. Give them a chance, include them in decision making and you see what this nation Nigeria will be. “When women are involved in something, that thing will have a transformation.”
