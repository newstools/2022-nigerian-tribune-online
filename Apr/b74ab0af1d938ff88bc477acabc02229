In what came as a surprise to many people, the eldest son of former Governor of Bauchi State, Ahmadu Adamu Mu’azu, Ahmed Ahmadu Mu’azu Jnr has indicated interest to contest the 2023 governorship election under the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) by buying the intent and nomination forms. Ahmed Ahmadu Mu’azu Junior aside after purchasing the PDP nomination forms, has also established his campaign structure as revealed by the Director-General of Ahmed Mu’azu Junior Campaign Organisation, Dr Kabiru Garba Ilelah. He said that his desire to be in the contest is to create employment opportunities and to accord priority to healthcare, education, agriculture, security, rural transformation and industrialisation in the state. Ilelah also said that Mu’azu Jnr will do his best to employ hundreds of professionals that have retired from the various ministries in Bauchi State civil service for more than a decade without replacement.

The campaign DG further said that the young Ahmed Muazu is not contesting against the incumbent State Governor, Senator Bala Mohammed Abdulkadir, but he is contesting because the Governor is now contesting for the Presidential seat. He said, “We saw Governor Bala had already purchased the PDP presidential nominations form to contest for the President of Nigeria 2023. Young Ahmed Mu’azu has a lot of respect for the incumbent Bauchi State Governor whom he considered as his leader and elder statesman and a father.” He said that it is time for a generational shift in the leadership of the state where youths should brace up and take up leadership positions and demonstrate their capacity in governance.
