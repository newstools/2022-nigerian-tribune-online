I am a 25-year old man. I supplement my income with regular blood donation after which I am asked to have a malt and milk drink to replace the blood I have donated. I want to know if this is true because the last time I donated blood, I felt very dizzy even after drinking malt and milk. Chuks (by SMS)  Even though some malt drinks are also fortified with vitamins, so consuming all these will deliver nutrients to the body, however, mixing milk and malt with the notion that it will increase blood volume is unrealistic. There is no scientific evidence for that. As was mentioned in a past edition of this column, you must wait at least eight weeks (56 days) between donations of whole blood. This limits you to blood donation of 6 times a year.
