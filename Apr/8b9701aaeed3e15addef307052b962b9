The House of Representatives on Thursday mandated the Committee on National Security and Intelligence to investigate the operational and co-operational lapses by Nigeria intelligence agencies which had led to the dearth of adequate intelligence in the country This followed the adoption of a motion, “Need to Strengthen the Intelligence Gathering Capacity of Security Agencies in Nigeria” moved by Hon. Dennis Idahosa at the plenary. The House noted the recent rising sequence of insecurity across the country in the forms of kidnappings, terrorism and cattle rustling and farmers/herders conflicts amongst others The House also noted that the situation could be attributed to the dearth of timely and adequate intelligence gathering which had rendered security activities in the country ineffective. This, it said, encourages attacks by insurgents, bandits and kidnappers due to the absence of intelligence that would have prompted pre-emptive or proactive actions by the security forces. IN CASE YOU MISSED THESE FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE The House said it was aware that the lack of professional handling of sensitive intelligence (information) has led to colossal loss of lives and properties across the country, particularly in the North-East and North-West Zone. It observed that frosty relationships among the security forces and the citizens are another challenge to security operations, hence the near-collapse of the gathering of intelligence. The House said there is need to improve the professional standards of Nigeria security agencies in the aggressive gathering of intelligence and restructure the general intelligence architecture. It said it was conscious of the significant role of intelligence in security operations to surmount the ongoing war against insurgency in Nigeria. The committee was to report back within eight weeks for further legislative action.
