Government offices including those of the Federation as well as private and public offices joined markets and motor parks across Enugu State, in near-total compliance with the sit-at-home protest in solidarity with detained IPOB leader, Mazi Nnamdi Nnamdi Kanu who is appearing in FHC, Abuja. The streets are bare, shops, garages, restaurants, pharmacies, schools, banks and other business concerns are all shut. Security and military agencies are on the prowl patrolling the major roads and streets. However, some skeletal economic activities operate in the inner streets where okpa and other food hawkers as well black market fuel operators and POS agents make brisk business. No reports of violence have so far been recorded.
