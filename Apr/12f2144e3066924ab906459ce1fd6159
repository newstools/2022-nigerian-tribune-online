On March 10, 2021 a downpour accompanied by storm wrecked havoc in Obada which is generally called OdoOba in Ogo Oluwa Local Government Area of Oyo State in which more than two hundred houses and lock up shops had their roofs blown off while foodstuffs and other perishable items went with it. The Broadcasting Corporation of Oyo State (BCOS) crew on the invitation of Oba Sunday Oladapo Oyediran, the Onpetu of Ijeru and Olu Samuel Oladosu Oyekunle of Obada went round the town and its market to capture the extent of the disaster. Thereafter, a comprehensive report was forwarded to the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), Abuja and Oyo State Emergency Management Agency(OYSEMA) for the provision of relief materials to the affected people. However, the people are still looking forward to receiving relief materials from these government agencies.  Obada was similarly affected in 2007 and no succor was given. It is on this premise that we beseech the agencies at state and federal levels to come to the aid of victims of March 10, 2021 rain storm at Obada (Odooba). Adelani Olawuyi, Oyo State
