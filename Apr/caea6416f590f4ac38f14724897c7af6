Justice Binta Nyako of the Federal High Court Abuja, on Friday, struck out 8 out of the 15-count charge preferred against the detained self-acclaimed leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Mazi Nnamdi Kanu by the Federal Government. The Judge freed Nnamdi Kanu on the 8 counts while ruling on a preliminary objection filed by the IPOB leader challenging the validity of the 15-count amended charge preferred against him by the Federal Government. “In this instant preliminary objection application, I have read the counts and come to the conclusion that counts 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 14 have not disclosed any offence against the Defendant. “‘Counts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8 and 15 show some allegations, which the Defendant has to answer. The court shall proceed to try the defendant on those counts”, Justice Nyako held. The Judge then slated May 18 and 26 2022 to deliver a ruling on Nnamdi Kanu’s bail application. The IPOB leader is being prosecuted by the Federal Government on offences bordering on terrorism.
