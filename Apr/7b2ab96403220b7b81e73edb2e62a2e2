The authorities of the Lagos State Waterways Authority (LASWA) have debunked reports of a boat mishap in Falomo area of Lagos on Tuesday. A statement signed by Wuraola Alake, the Public Affairs Officer of LASWA, stated that: “The attention of the Lagos State Waterways Authority has been drawn to a video making rounds across social media falsely claiming that a boat mishap occurred at the Five Cowries Terminal this morning 26th of April 2022. “The incident in the purported boat mishap video was actually a routine safety simulation exercise being carried out by the LASWA Emergency Rescue Team as part of their Training Exercise. “The training demonstration is part of LASWA’s safety preparedness against any possible incident on the State Inland Waterways. “LASWA wishes to state categorically that no such incident of boat mishap whatsoever occured anywhere on the state Inland Waterways in recent time. “We, therefore, urge the general public to disregard this video as it was done unprofessionally by an unknown source without proper Investigation and verification.”
