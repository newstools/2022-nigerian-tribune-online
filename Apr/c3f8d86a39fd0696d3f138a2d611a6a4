BROADCASTER, Alhaji AbdulRasaq AbdulGaneey, popularly known as Mr GRA, has declared his intention to run for the seat of Ibadan North Constituency 1 in the Oyo State House of Assembly in the 2023 general election on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC). He made the declaration on Wednesday while hosting a second Ramadan lecture in Ibadan, where popular preacher, Sheikh Taofeek Akeugbagold, discussed the topic ‘Islam, Politics and Governance: Prophet Muhammad as a Role Model’. AbdulGaneey stated that his decision to join politics was not based on wish for wealth acquisition but a yearning to bring meaningful development to Ibadan North Constituency 1. He said: “Politics is an opportunity to serve humanity. As a journalist, I always advocate good governance and quality representation. Now, it is time to practise what I have been preaching on air over the years.  “Hence, my desire to represent my people in the 10th Oyo State House of Assembly is a resolve to serve. Legislature is the bedrock of democracy. I am fully prepared. I will sponsor masses-oriented bills and motions and facilitate meaningful constituency projects in every nook and cranny of my constituency.” Akeugbagold advised the state chapter of the APC to support AbdulGaneey to emerge as its candidate for the constituency in the next general election, saying the aspirant possessed the ability to succeed as a legislator. The cleric urged the House of Assembly hopeful to, “if you eventually got the ticket and won the general election,” be dutiful to his fellow constituents and remain loyal to the APC and its ideals. In attendance at the lecture were dignitaries, including businesswoman, Alhaja Faoziyah Bola Salami and Alhaji Gbolagade Awujoola (the Aare Musulumi of Ologuneru and environs), as well as APC leaders, ward chairmen and eminent members of the party within and beyond Ibadan North Local Government Area.
