AGAIN, the national grid for the third time in 2022 collapsed, losing over 3,317MWs power on Friday evening. This had led to power outages in many parts of the country. A check at the data from the system operator showed that as of 6am on Saturday, only five Generation Companies (GenCos) were on the grid, with a total of 473.80MWs. These are: three units of the Azura-Edo IPP (GAS) with 231 MWs, two units of Kainji (Hydro) 88MWs, Omotosho(Gas) 15MWs, Omotosho NIPP (GAS) 24.80MWs and Shiroro (HYDRO) whose two units contributed 115MWs. Meanwhile, as of 3pm on Saturday, the total generation was 1006.10MWs generated by six GenCos-Geregu, Kainji (Hydro), Olorunsogo NIPP (Gas), Omotosho (Gas), Omotosho NIPP(Gas), TransAmadi (Gas). While confirming the development, the Minister of Power, Abubakar Aliyu in a statement said the system operator and the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC), have commenced a detailed investigation into the immediate and remote causes of the recurring grid failure. He said the process of restoring supply is ongoing with some sections of the national grid already energised and supply restored to consumers. He added that the Federal Government is also working on the delivery of the SCADA which would help to improve the capacity of the grid. “We wish to assure Nigerians that the Federal Government is working assiduously to deliver on the much-needed reforms and investments, including SCADA, that are critical to improving the capacity and reliability of the national grid. “This is in line with the Mr. President’s directives on closing infrastructure deficits in critical sectors of the Nigerian economy,” the statement added.
