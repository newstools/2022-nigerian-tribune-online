Dear Mr President, with utmost respect to you and your office, it is disheartening to let know you that we had a great opportunity for the country to regain its lost glory when we had a change of government in 2015 with unwavering hope that the administration would set an agenda for national rebirth and put the economy on reset. But in the past seven years, the administration has failed to create the basis for improved economic prosperity. When the news broke that the National Council of State under you endorsed the pardon of Dariye, Nyame and 157 other convicts, it was shocking. Certainly, your decision violated your oath of office and allegiance to defend the constitution. In my view, the pardon will nurture and elevate corruption. It is so sad and counterproductive in addition to the moral implications of granting pardon to such people. Granting such pardon has really tarnished your credibility and stand on corruption because crimes are vices that should not be tolerated by any government. Abba Dukawa, Kano.
