LAGOS State deserves to be given special status due to its economic importance to the nation as it remains the economic nerve centre of Nigeria which cannot be overlooked or pushed aside. This is part of the assignments that I expect the people voted into office to represent the people at the National Assembly to fight for. They should lobby other National Assembly legislators to get special status for Lagos supported with incidental infrastructural development to make it world- class standard. The people of Lagos deserve more than they are getting in every sphere considering the kind of wealth the state has and what it makes financially in terms of revenue. Also, there is urgent need to eradicate toll-gates within Lagos, especially along Lagos-Epe axis. The financial base of Lagos needs to be expanded by developing waterways and
blue sea economy. Governance is about people. Politics should be about quality service to the people as opposed to the politics of looting the commonwealth of the states and Nigeria as it is common in the nation today. I implore Nigerians to overwhelmingly vote out failed candidates during the 2023 general election. We should not allow deceivers to take us for a ride again. It is time to retrieve the country from looters.  • Chief Adesunbo Onitiri,
