By dint of hard work and unrivalled grace, he has continued to grow in his career in leaps and bounds over the years. “Chief Ebenezer Obey, who is also the General Overseer of Decross Gospel Missions, is a multitalented composer, singer, manager of men and resources, whose love for gospel music and reformative lyrics is second to none.” Ajirotutu, in the statement, continued: “Obey, as a family man and lover of children, uses his brand of music to orientate the public towards the civic duties and equally draws attention of various governments to their responsibilities towards the governed. “On this occasion of his 80th birthday anniversary, I wish to congratulate the evergreen musician. It is my prayers that God in his infinite mercies shall continue to strengthen him in all his areas of needs. He shall live long in good health and continue to serve God and humanity. May the Lord spare him to see more years in the land of the living. “Congratulations to Obey, the evergreen musician.”
