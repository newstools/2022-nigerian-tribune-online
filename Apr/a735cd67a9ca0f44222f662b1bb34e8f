At 15 years, I noticed that unlike my friends of the same age, I don’t have any single strand of hair on my face. I have used a lot of ointments and methylated spirit as suggested by my friends but nothing has happened. Kindly help me. Ken (by SMS)  Getting hair on your face is one of the last changes of puberty. On the average, boys start noticing hair on their face around age 15 or 16. Exactly when the changes of puberty occur can vary a lot. Heredity plays some part, but some boys just grow facial, body, and genital hair at different ages. And how fast the changes occur can also vary. That means some boys start growing a beard very early in their teenage years. Others don’t notice a beard starting until they are much older. So if the guys you know have whiskers, while you barely have any fuzz on your cheek, there’s probably nothing wrong with you. Your beard will start growing soon enough.
