During my recent routine medical examination, I was informed that I have Cataracts. According to the doctor, the Cataracts are not matured enough to be removed surgically. I want to know if there is anything I can do to clear the Cataracts. Chief Nzem (by SMS)  Cataracts are a normal part of aging, but they are not something you have to live with.  If your cataract is small and isn’t causing you any vision problems, there are some things you can do to put off cataract surgery. While it would not be healthy to avoid all exposure to the sun, it’s best to avoid going out when the glare is brightest and the UV light is strongest. This is usually from 10 am to 4 pm most of the year. When you do go out, be sure to wear good sunglasses that protect your peripheral vision and offer full-spectrum protection. Wear sunglasses and a hat, stay out of the sun, and get regular exams so you know the status of your cataracts. Eye drops with steroids reduce inflammation and can help with dry eyes and arthritis of the eyes, but they can also speed up the progression of your cataracts if you already have them. Eat plenty of vegetables and fruits that are rich in antioxidants. Get as rich a variety of vitamins and minerals in your diet as possible, and avoid lots of carbohydrates, processed foods, and trans fats. Dehydration can also cause your cataracts to develop more quickly, so drink plenty of water and avoid too much alcohol. Smoking also makes it more likely cataracts will progress, so if you need the motivation to quit, let cataracts be it.
