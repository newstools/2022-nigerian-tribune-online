Citing the new judgment of the Enugu Division of the Court of Appeal on defection, a Federal High Court in Abuja on Thursday refused to declare vacant the governorship seat of Ben Ayade of Cross River State, over his defection from the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) to the All Progressive Congress (APC). Justice Taiwo Taiwo departed from his earlier judgment and held onto the decision of the Court of Appeal delivered on April 1, 2022, to the effect that defection is not an offence under the Nigerian Constitution for now. The judge held that governors and their deputies can only be removed from office in line with Sections 180, 188 and 189 of the Constitution which stipulated that elective officeholders can only be removed from office on account of death, resignation or impeachment. Justice Taiwo said that since defection is not one of the Constitutional provisions, no court has the power to insert such into the supreme law and agreed that defection from a winning party to a losing one is immoral and improper.
