Cristiano Ronaldo has announced the tragic death of his baby son after long-term partner Georgina Rodriguez gave birth to a twin boy and twin girl, the Daily Star of UK has reported. He wrote on Instagram in a joint statement signed by the couple: “It is with our deepest sadness we have to announce that our baby boy has passed away. It is the greatest pain that any parents can feel. “Only the birth of our baby girl gives us the strength to live this moment with some hope and happiness. “We would like to thank the doctors and nurses for all their expert care and support. We are all devastated at this loss and we kindly ask for privacy at this very difficult time. “Our baby boy, you are our angel. We will always love you.” Back in October, Ronaldo announced the pair were expecting twins in an Instagram post that read: “Delighted to announce we are expecting twins.  “Our hearts are full of love – we can’t wait to meet you.” The couple then confirmed in December that they had been expecting both a boy and a girl in a gender-reveal video that featured their other children. The now heart-breaking clip showed the four youngsters popping balloons which were filled with both blue and pink confetti. The two boys said: ‘It’s a boy’ and the two girls said: ‘It’s a girl’ after Georgina had given them a countdown, with Ronaldo adding the caption: “Where life begins and love never ends.” Georgina, who is from Argentina, met Ronaldo while she was working as a Gucci shop assistant in 2016, during his time playing for Real Madrid. She has since grown close with Ronaldo’s other children, Cristiano Jr, 11, as well as twins Mateo and Eva, four. Georgina had carried four-year-old daughter Alana before falling pregnant with the twins last year.  (Daily Star)
