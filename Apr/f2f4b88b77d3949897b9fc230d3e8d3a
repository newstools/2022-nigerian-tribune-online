Now that restrictions about the COVID 19 infection are down, I want to know if it is necessary to continue to put on face masks. Salman (by SMS)  While it is true that many countries have relaxed their rules on mask wearing, with around 70% of Americans no longer required to wear a face covering indoors, these rules are for countries with a high level of vaccinated population. The new guidelines are not meant for countries with a very low percentage of vaccinated population. In addition, the elderly as well as those with underlying medical issues that could expose people to COVID 19 infection are still required to use their face masks especially in crowded and public enclosed indoor areas.
