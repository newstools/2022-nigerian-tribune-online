BARRING any last-minute unforeseen circumstances, Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo will in the next few days formally declare his intention to vie for the presidential ticket of the All Progressives Congress (APC), the Nigerian Tribune has learnt. This is coming after much speculation over his moves and several pushbacks by his aides and close associates. Before now, his spokesman, Laolu Akande, had rejected reports of the vice president’s impending declaration, often describing them as false and speculative. But he had also maintained that any information about it will come from him and not the media. It was learnt that Osinbajo, who has in recent times, become more visible on the road, has indeed been feeling the pulse of trusted stakeholders and is now convinced that it is time to make an announcement. Before now, there have been doubts as to whether he could join the race following the early declaration of the national leader of the APC, Senator Bola Tinubu, who some have said he might not dare by seeking the same ticket. However, Osinbajo has come under sustained pressure by his supporters who feel that as the incumbent vice president, he should have the right of first refusal over the APC ticket. Notable among them is Osinbajo Grassroots Organisation (OGO), which the promoters say was formed “out of the genuine passion to be part of a process that would help our dear nation identify a man of purpose who could lead our country and reposition Nigeria.”
