I read it somewhere that groundnuts can cause pimples. I am a teenager who has a lot of pimples and at the same time, love eating groundnuts. Kindly advise me on what to do since I love eating groundnuts and gari a lot. Akin (by SMS)  While acne is basically a condition where the glands are producing so much serums, the pimples seen on the skin is the manifestation of acne on the skin. Therefore, the pimple is just like a symptoms of the acne, but then, a lot of people just use it interchangeably. Although groundnuts, cheese, butter and a whole lot of other foods have been stated to be the cause of pimples, nutritionists, dietitians,  researchers and medical experts do not agree with this claim. They however encourage a healthy diet, good hygiene, exercise and other healthy activities to make bodies fit and beautiful.
