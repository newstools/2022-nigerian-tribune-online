Nigeria’s former president, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, on Sunday, declared that Nigeria is no longer safe as a result of the insecurity challenges confronting it. He hinted that the present administration of Muhammadu Buhari is overwhelmed by the challenge, saying Nigerians are no longer safe on the train or at the airport. The former president stated this while receiving a Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential aspirant, Dr Ugochukwu Williams at his residence in Abeokuta. He, therefore, urged Nigerians not to allow the security challenge to overwhelm them and the country. “Nigerians are no longer safe on the road, on the train and at the airport. This calls for a concerted effort of stakeholders to stem the tide of insecurity in the country. “So, if anybody comes to say I want to see you, I want to talk to you, I will say ‘you’re welcome’. This is because I believe very strongly, and I have said it publicly and I will say it again that the situation we are in this country is not a situation where one man will say yes, he has a solution unless we are deceiving ourselves. I believe we need to sit down collectively and look at the situation. “A situation where you are not safe on the road, you are not safe on the train, you are not safe at the airport, that shows a very serious situation. “I believe that all right-thinking Nigerians must know that we have a situation that has overwhelmed the present administration, but we should not allow that situation to overwhelm Nigeria.” Williams said he was in Abeokuta for consultation with the statesman over his presidential ambition. He described Obasanjo as a leader who is passionate about the peace and unity of Nigeria. IN CASE YOU MISSED THESE FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE
