For years, we have watched a lot of Nigerian youths engaging in the sagging of their trousers in a way that what should not be exposed to public eye, is in the open. And this affects the way they walk as you see many of them waddle like penguins on our streets. Somehow, this has become a fashion trend among youths because they see foreign celebrities dressed in this manner and they emulate the style like they usually do for foreign trends. Sagging is a form of dressing in which the top of the trousers or jeans is significantly below the waist, sometimes revealing much of the underwear. This fashion style is also referred to as low-riding. Sagging originated from the United States prison; it is a trend that originated from prisoners as this is the only way they can wear their trousers due to the fact that their belts are usually seized to stop them from using it to wound themselves.  It is a misconception; an extreme one at that for Nigerian youths to think it’s fashion just because some do it. Youths should learn to research and think deep, reason beyond the superficial before embracing trends especially in fashion and lifestyle. Another reason I believe youths sag is that they want to belong and so they try to emulate their friend’s mode of dressing, bowing to peer pressure. This act is not good for our society because it has a lot of negative effect on the youths themselves and also the upcoming generation. Youths should always dress in moderate and decent tones because it is said that the way you dress is the way you will be addressed. Parents should try and teach their children the proper ways of dressing to save the society from decadence. Government should make a law that will guide the dressing of youths.
