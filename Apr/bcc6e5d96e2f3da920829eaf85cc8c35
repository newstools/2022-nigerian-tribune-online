TWO middle-aged men alleged to be phone thieves were on Sunday killed in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital by a mob. The two men who operated on a motorcycle, Nigerian Tribune gathered, had robbed their victims of phones around Sharp Corner end of Apata/Oluyole Estate Extension road, but were chased by some group of people who witnessed the incident to the Alaafin Avenue end of Mobil/Oluyole Estate Extension road where they were waylaid, The stolen mobile phones were retrieved from them and were beaten to death. The leader of the men of the Nigerian Police from the Oluyole Estate Division of the Oyo State Police command, who craved anonymity told the Nigerian Tribune that they received information about the incident, but before they arrived at the scene, the two men had been beaten to death and none of those who carried out the act was on the ground when the team arrived. IN CASE YOU MISSED THESE FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE  An eyewitness simply identified as Feyisetan, who spoke with the Nigerian Tribune informed that: “It all started as if we were watching a movie when the two men on the motorcycle were waylaid. It was when they were beating them and mobile phones were being brought out of their pockets that we realised that they were phone thieves. “Series of robbery incidents are taking place around this axis lately, we want security agencies concerned to please beam more searchlight on this area to at least put a stop to these ugly incidents so as to save lives and property.” As of the time the Nigerian Tribune correspondent was leaving the scene, a police vehicle meant to transport the bodies of the phone thieves to a nearby mortuary had arrived.
