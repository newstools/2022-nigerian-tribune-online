THE National Organising Secretary of the Ansar-Ud-Deen Society of Nigeria (ADS), Alhaji Ibrahim Kilani, has donated some drugs and consumable items to Afin Akoko Basic Health Centre in Akoko North-West Local Government Area of Ondo State. Kilani said his gesture was meant to complement government’s investment in the health sector and to encourage pregnant and nursing mothers to patronise government health facilities where there are qualified medical officials. The ADS chieftain, who was represented at the distribution by an educationist, Mr Sedu Ikumuyite, decried the situation where people, particularly those living in rural areas, were not taking their health matters seriously. He commended the state government and Akoko North-West Local Government authorities for their “relentless efforts” at making health services available in all nooks and crannies of the state. Kilani promised to continue his donation next year to the annual babies award ceremony at the health centre, a programme which he initiated to encourage pregnant women and nursing mothers in the council area. The officer in charge of the health centre, Mrs Modupe Olowoyeye, commended the selflessness of the donor and promised that the donated items would be used accordingly.
