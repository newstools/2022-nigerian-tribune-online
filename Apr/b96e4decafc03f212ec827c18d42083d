President Muhammadu Buhari has transmitted Money Laundering and Terrorism Prevention bills to the House of Representatives. The President who calls for expedite consideration and passage of the two bills explained that the bills were sent by the Presidency pursuant to section 58(2) of the 1999 constitution (as amended). President Buhari observed: “During the recent mutual evaluation carried out by the inter-governmental action group against money laundering in West Africa, there was an observed deficiency in Nigeria’s anti-money laundering activities. According to him, sequel to the review of the policy, “Federal Ministry of Justice and relevant stakeholders reviewed the said deficiency and drafted the Money Laundry bill, 2022 and terrorism bill 2022.  “Unless these deficiencies are addressed promptly by the national assembly in order to bring the legal regime in conformity with the United Action Task Force recommendation, Nigeria will face the risk of negative public statement, blacklisting the country by the financial action task force, and this will lead to some negative consequences to our rapidly growing economy. “In the light of the above, the Federal Ministry of Justice reviewed the Money Laundering bill and Terrorism prevention bill currently pending before the National Assembly and have come up with versions of the bills, incorporating the deficiencies by the mutual evaluation report,” President Buhari stated in the letter.
