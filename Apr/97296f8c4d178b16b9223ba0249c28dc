The President, the National Association of Nigeria Travel Agencies (NANTA), Mrs Susan Akporiaye has requested the Federal Government, through the aviation authorities, to step up and activate proactive security measures to deter attacks on aviation infrastructure across the country. Mrs Akporiaye suggested that the process should be backed up with the best global security intelligence architecture, which will nip such negative intentions and breaches in the bud. “It’s certainly strange to wait to be attacked before we can respond, so we must advise that relevant government security agencies in charge of the critical aviation systems be put on the highest level of alert at the airports and the vicinities.” Mrs Akporiaye explained that all operators and workers in the aviation sector, should also be profiled daily and access to the cargo and passengers areas be limited and put under effective surveillance at both local and international airports in the country. To the families of victims of the Kaduna to Abuja rail shootings, Mrs Akporiaye said NANTA condoles with them and also prays for the quick recovery of those who were injured. “Our hearts bleed for our people and nation at this time. We urge everyone to remember our leaders and nation in our prayers but most importantly, let us join hands to take back our country from the hands of bandits and sponsors of dislocation of national developmental milestones.
