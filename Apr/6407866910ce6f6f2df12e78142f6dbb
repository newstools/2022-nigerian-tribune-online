Taraba State Sector Commander, Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Corps Commander Selina Williams on Friday warned dealers of motor parts against the sale of substandard or fake tyres to motorists in the state. Williams gave the warning at a meeting with the representatives of tyre dealers in Jalingo. The sector commander briefed the dealers of the various road clashes cases in the state where investigation report showed that tyre burst was a major cause. “This meeting will also serve as caution to all of you because the Command will work in collaboration with other Security agencies in a Joint Operation to rid dealers of substandard Tyres in the state. “As dealers in tyres, you are considered a stake holder in Road Safety in the State and are suppose to key fully into the Commands activities geared towards making Taraba free of substandard tyres which in turn translate into reducing the rate of road clashes,” she said. She called on the dealers to register an association to enable the command coordinate a regular meeting and training for them, vulcanizers and transport unions for better results. Mr Livinus Onyekere, the leader of the dealers thanked the Sector Commander for the opportunity to standardize their business. Onyekere pointed out the lack coordination amongst dealers that could enable them speak in one voice under one umbrella body and check the activities of their members and Vulcanizers as a major challenge. He explained that only professionals vulcanizers would know that there were different pressure gauge for different tyres.
