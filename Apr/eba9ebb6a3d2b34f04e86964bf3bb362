SENIOR media practitioners in the country have been charged to train young practitioners in the practice to enable them uphold the  ethics of the profession. Making the charge in Lagos, at a retreat, organized for the nation’s media practitioners, by the Dangote Group, the Group Head, Corporate Communications, Dangote, Mr. Tony Chiejina stated that the call had become imperative to enable the media profession maintain its status of  being the watchdog of the society. According to him, despite its obvious advantages, the advent of technology had  begun to have its negative impacts on the profession; especially with the proliferation of citizen journalism. “With technology, every individual, with android can now disseminate information, even when not trained in the act. “Unfortunately, this is beginning to take its toll on the profession; because some of these news are  not always truthful. “I think this is why you people here, who are senior practitioners should train and mentor the younger ones, in the profession, in the interest of the practice. You need to ensure that you have capable hands that can take over from you while you are no longer in the profession,” he stated.  Chiejina explained that the retreat, organized by the Dangote Group, in collaboration with Folio Media, was designed to help practitioners hone their skills, and keep them abreast of developments in the practice.
