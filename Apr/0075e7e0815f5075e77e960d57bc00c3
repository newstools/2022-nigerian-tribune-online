The Anambra State Governor, Prof Chukwuma Soludo, joined hundreds of worshippers at  St. Patrick’s Cathedral Church, Awka, for Palm Sunday. Soludo in his remarks spoke about the significance of the occasion and the need for the people to emulate the teachings, love and peace that Jesus Christ signifies. He reiterated that the insecurity being perpetrated in the state was the handiwork of people who are not indigenes of Anambra State. He urged the people to cooperate with the government to flush out these criminal elements if they refuse to accept the amnesty being granted to them. He noted that his government is ready to rehabilitate and assist the repented elements to begin a new meaningful life. He warned, however, that those criminals who refused to renounce criminalities will have themselves to blame. He, therefore, urged the people to cooperate and work harmoniously together to reclaim their land back from these criminal elements rampaging and killing innocent people at will. In his homily to mark the occasion, His Lordship, Most Rev’d Paulinus Ezeokafor, urged the congregation to emulate the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. Ezeokafor noted that Christ’s suffering and endurance are part of the grace that humanity enjoys today He also called on the people of Anambra State to support Governor Soludo in his genuine efforts to rid the state of criminal elements. He urged the people not to be cowed but to brace up and ensure peace and tranquillity return to Anambra State.
