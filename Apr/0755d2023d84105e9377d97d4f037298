IN CASE YOU MISSED THESE FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE He stated that: “As AIG for the zone, I’m sure you will leverage on your vast network to be able to really coordinate the states within your zone because what we have realized in the FCT is that criminal activities are usually hatched outside the territory and then people come into the territory, perform these acts and move across the borders to the surrounding states” Bello said. Earlier, the AIG, Zone 7 Police headquarters, Mr Muhammad Ndatsu Aliyu who pledged commitment to work in synergy with all security organs of government to secure the zone, solicited the support of the FCTA, in the area of mobility for effective coverage of the zone and by extension, the FCT.
