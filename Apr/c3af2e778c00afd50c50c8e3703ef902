Students of Ebonyi State University (EBSU) have charged the management of the institution to postpone their examination. According to them, the postponement of two faculty from other faculties in the institution will not help the school. The students through their SUG President Okporo Camillus stated this in Abakaliki during a peaceful protest at the Ishieke main campus. Okporo noted that a general extension of the exam by the school management will help the students get fully prepared for the exam. He also pleaded with the school management to extend the school fees payment and also allow even those that are yet to pay their tuition fees to write their exam. When Tribune Online contacted the school Public Relations Officer, Patrick Itumo, he confirmed the demonstration by the students.

His words: “The management and the students leadership has met and the management directed that the exam for the two most affected faculty be suspended for now, while others without issues continue with their exams.” Responding to the issue of school fees, Itumo said “the management has directed that students be allowed to write their exams even when they have not paid but urged the students to endeavour to pay their fees after the exams or will not have access to their results.” He however encouraged students to always get proper information from their leaders before taking any action. He also commended the security agencies for their intervention which helped to stop the protest from escalating.
