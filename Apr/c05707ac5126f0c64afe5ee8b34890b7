There is need to crush criminal gangs now before they pull down our nation. One major problem which is facing Nigeria has to do with the incessant killing of Nigerians living in every part of the country. The security situation in the country is disheartening and it is obvious that some politicians and elite have politicised the security of this nation. This is not the time to politicise our security. Nobody knows the next victim.  It is just a pity that a son of one serving commissioner in the northern part of Nigeria was murdered. Everyone is living in the state of fear and no one knows who the next  victim is. President Muhammadu Buhari needs to address this insecurity. Let me also use this medium to call on the presidency to promptly attend to the demand of the bandits who kidnapped 167 Nigerians by facilitating their release. The Federal government must not allow bandits to kill these innocent citizens. It is time for the presidency to address key issues with seriousness and not mere platitudes. Those who are sponsoring these criminals to kill and kidnap Nigerians must be arrested and brought to book without minding whose ox is gored. Enough is enough.  Barrister Jimoh Mumin, Ibadan.
