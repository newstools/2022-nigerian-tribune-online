A caterer, Adebunmi Oyebanjo,  has begged  an Igando Customary Court in Lagos, Lagos State, to dissolve her marriage to her husband,  Sunkanmi, for alleged constant beating. According to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), Adebunmi, who resides in Igando area of Lagos, also accused her husband of humiliating and locking her up at home. “My husband is fond of picking a fight with me over minor issues and beating me. “I’m not even allowed to relate with neighbours. If he sees me having any discussion with them, he will fight me and tear my cloth. “The beating is too much. He will sometimes lock me up in the house and take the key along with him. “He does not provide me feeding allowance. He leaves me to my fate. “He is not the same man I married. He smokes, drinks and womanises. He gets home drunk too and starts misbehaving. I’m fed up with the marriage and I want the court to separate us,” she said. The respondent, Sunkanmi, was absent in court. The court president, Mr Koledoye Adeniyi, adjourned the suit.
