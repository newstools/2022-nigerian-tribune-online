Two persons have been killed while a member of the House of Representatives, representing Bassa/Jos North federal constituency in Plateau State Musa Agah Auta and his family escaped an ambush by gunmen on Tuesday night. According to a statement signed by the Secretary Irigwe Development Association (IDA) Danjuma Auta, the federal lawmaker alongside his wife, children, driver and his personal assistant were ambushed
along twin hill in Miango chiefdom of Bassa local government area of Plateau State. The statement depicted that all occupants of the vehicle escaped unhurt but the car was riddled with bullets by the gunmen. “Although they all escaped unhurt but the car was battered with gunshot bullets as the driver against all odds bravely manoeuvred the vehicle amidst the sporadic shooting by the attackers” The statement added that two others who were on a motorcycle and ahead of the lawmaker’s vehicle ran into the ambush and were killed by the attackers. It would be recalled that Hon Auta was elected into the House of Representatives through a by-election conducted by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in February this year.  Gunmen have been terrorising the local government especially Miango axis for quite sometime. Recently, no fewer than ten people were killed, several houses burnt and farms destroyed in the area. Security agencies are yet to react to the incident which occurred near the spot where some people were killed recently during a festival ceremony in the chiefdom.
