The Obafemi Awolowo family has mourned the passing of Chief (Mrs) Oyibo Ekwulo Odinamadu, a former National Vice President of the Unity Party of Nigeria (UPN) and staunch Awoist. A statement signed by Ambassador Dr Olatokunbo Awolowo Dosumu, for the Awolowo family, stated that: “We received with sadness the news of the transition to eternity of Chief (Mrs) Oyibo Ekwulo Odinamadu which occurred recently in the United States. She was aged 94. “Chief (Mrs) Odinamadu was the National Vice President of the Unity Party of Nigeria (UPN) from 1979 to December 1983. “We remember her as a very loyal deputy to the president of the party, Papa Chief Obafemi Awolowo. “She was also a very committed democrat and party loyalist who never sacrificed the core foundational principles of the UPN. She was a believer in a Nigeria where no man or woman was oppressed. “Painful as her death is, we are happy that she lived well and died well leaving behind worthy legacies in civil and women rights as well as in advocacy for good governance. “She was a founding member of the National Council for Women Societies (NCWS) and headed the Eastern wing of the society for over two decades. “Her death has made everyone connected with her poorer. We pray that God, in His infinite mercies will repose her soul and protect the family she left behind.”
