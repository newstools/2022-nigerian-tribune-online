A community leader, Isiaku Madaki, was murdered in his residence at Kakura in Chikun local government area of Kaduna State in the early hours of Sunday. A resident of the area, Baban David, revealed that the deceased was on Saturday installed as the Head of the community. Tribune Online reports that Kakura, a community predominantly occupied by the Gbagi tribe also has other tribes with few Fulani settlers who have lived in the community for decades. “We all gathered in his residence earlier in the day (Saturday) to rejoice with him over his appointment. However, we were shocked when in the early hours of today (Sunday) when we began to hear gunshots. “We were afraid we could not come out of our houses. Later we were told that the gunmen had killed him in the presence of his wife and family. “We found his dead body laying on the ground. His wife told us the gunmen broke into their residence and shot him. They did not take anything, neither did they abduct anybody,” the source said.
