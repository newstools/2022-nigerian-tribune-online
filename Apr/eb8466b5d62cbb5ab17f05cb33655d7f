Behind every successful artist is a ‘management’ toiling day and night to see him grow, says Founder and Chief Marketing officer at Mp3bullet Media, Seun Akinsanya.  He thinks that an artist’s success is mostly contingent on his or her manager. As a result of their status as a brand, artists are managed like businesses, and as a result, they are unable to make choices on their own. The record label, the booking agency, and the band are all important components of a musician’s career, as are tours, recordings, publications, merchandise, and public relations. The management’s role is to ensure that all of these components are properly balanced and in sync.. If a musician wants to succeed in the music business, he or she must devote their whole attention to their craft and surround themselves with colleagues and representatives who can provide just as much value as they do.

He may take on a range of tasks, encouraging the artist’s creativity while also overseeing the commercial aspects of their career. When it comes to management, Akinsanya thinks that artists, particularly independent ones, need to be extremely careful. “It’s extremely important for independent artists to exercise caution when selecting a suitable management,” he said. There are a number of artists whose careers have been stifled because of poor or no management. The most successful artists are those that don’t fade away or go away at all. They are constants. Momentum reverses the moment an artist stops pushing ahead. A good manager would never allow this to happen to his band/artist. “A musician’s career may be made or shattered by the management he or she picks to monitor it,” Akinsanya concluded.
