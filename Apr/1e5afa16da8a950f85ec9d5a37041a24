Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq of Kwara state has congratulated the Christian community on the Easter festivities, calling it a period of reunion, self-discipline, sacrifice, forgiveness, and commitment to God. In a statement by the Chief Press Secretary (CPS) to the governor, Rafiu Ajakaye, on Saturday, the governor called on Nigerians to take advantage of the period to seek God’s favour for the country and to reunite against all forces of evil who seek to tear the country apart and terrorise its people with violence and economic sabotage. “That this Easter period coincides with the Muslims’ month of Ramadan – in which self-discipline and increased virtues are seriously encouraged — is in fact a signal to the faith communities to unite, speak, act and pray in one accord for a greater Nigeria. Let us come together to fight all forces of evil that work against peace and development,” he said. “At this Easter and beyond, I wish everyone greater strides and glad tidings as we recommit ourselves to a better Nigeria and stronger ties as a community of people bounded by a common destiny.”  YOU SHOULD NOT MISS THESE HEADLINES FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE How Workplace Sexual Harassment Forces Many Out Of Their Dream Jobs Despite several laws prohibiting sexual harassment in Nigeria, many victims are forced to quit their dream jobs while others suffer depression as a result of unsolicited sexual advances from colleagues.
