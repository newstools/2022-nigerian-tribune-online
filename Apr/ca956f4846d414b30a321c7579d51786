GUNMEN on Friday invaded Isuofia community in Aguata Local Government Area of Anambra State where the state governor, Professor Charles Soludo, hails from. It was gathered one policeman was killed in the incident that happened at a junction leading to the governor’s house. A source said the gunmen stormed the junction, where security operatives were stationed, and attacked the operatives. The source said the gunmen were angered by the idea of stationing a security post in the area.  “The hoodlums stormed the area, shooting nonstop while residents scampered for safety. One policeman was killed in the process,” the source said. But the state police command debunked reports that the house of Governor Soludo was attacked. In a statement by its spokesman, Ikenga Tochukwu, the police said: “Soludo’s house was not attacked. To set the record straight, police observation point along Ekwulobia Expressway in Aguata Local Government Area came under attack late hours of Thursday. “The mobile personnel posted at the point gallantly repelled the attack but unfortunately, three of them sustained gunshot injuries during the duel with the hoodlums. “Following the quick deployment of operatives in the area by the command, calm has since returned to the area. “Meanwhile, operation is still ongoing. Further details shall be communicated.
