The Edo State Police Command has refuted an online report that a suspected ritualist with human leg was apprehended at a police checkpoint on Akhionbare Street, GRA, Benin City. A Tuesday morning viral video circulating online had depicted the arrest of a boy, who was said to have been in possession of human parts, by an angry mob. However, the state Command Spokesperson, Bello Kontongs, said that the online report was a misrepresentation of facts as no ritualist was apprehended. The PPRO added that it was an accident that claimed the life of a security man. “The incident is misrepresentation of fact. The car was involved in an accident and the leg seen in the car is for one of the victims who died on the spot and his body has already been deposited at the mortuary. “The vehicle hit the security man and severed his left leg but he later died. The other security man that fractured his leg as a result of the accident has been taken to Plateau State by his family where they set the bone,” he added.
