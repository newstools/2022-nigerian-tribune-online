Former President Goodluck Jonathan is yet to come clear about a possible bid for the presidency in 2023. He made this known in Abuja when a crowd of his supporters thronged his Abuja office on Friday, asking him to contest for president in the forthcoming General Election. The supporters came bearing posters with inscriptions including ‘Goodluck Jonathan must run for president 2023′, ‘Jonathan is our candidate’, and more. After a meeting with the supporters, he came out to declare: “You are calling me to come and declare for the next election. I cannot tell you I’m declaring. The political process is ongoing, just watch out. “The key role you must play is to pray that Nigeria gets somebody that carries the young people along; somebody that can also work very hard to see that some of the problems are addressed by the government and I believe collectively, we will work together.” Ex-president Jonathan has been in the news for sometime over a possible comeback in 2023 after losing a second term bid to incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari in 2015.
