Hundreds of bandits raided some houses at Anguwar Maji in Jere town of Kaduna State and abducted 22 villagers on Sunday. The abduction, it was gathered came barely 24 hours after the Inspector General of Police (IGP), Baba Usman Alkali went on patrol at the busy Abuja/Kaduna highway. The IGP, during the patrol on Sunday, told journalists that the road is safe for the public. However, a resident of Anguwar Maji, Shehu Bala, said the latest abduction happened around 11 pm on Sunday when the bandits invaded the community. He said the invaders who came in large numbers, stormed several houses and abducted 22 villagers including five women. “The bandits came in their large numbers as some of them wore army uniforms. “They moved from house to house and woke their victims up before they marched them into the bush at gunpoint.” Bala said one among the 22 kidnapped victims escaped from his abductors while being led into the bush. At the time of filing this report, the police could not be reached for confirmation.
