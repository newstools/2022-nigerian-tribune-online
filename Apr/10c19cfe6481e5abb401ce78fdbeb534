The General Overseer of Holy Ghost Power Assembly worldwide, Bishop Sola Olubadejo, has decried the statement credited to an Islamic group, Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC) which described the vice president, Yemi Osinbajo’s presidential declaration as unethical. Bishop Olubadejo disclosed this while reacting to MURIC’s statement in a press statement released to the media in Osogbo on Friday. He noted that MURIC’s description of that Osinbajo’s presidential declaration as backstabbing the national leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Bola Tinubu, is uncalled for and unacceptable He said the group’s statement which was signed by its founder and director, Professor Ishaq Akintola, was worthless.  Bishop Olubadejo added that the statement from Akintola accusing Osinbajo of carrying out an instruction of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), following the creation of a political department is wrong, saying Osinbajo has been on his presidential ambition ever before the creation of a political department in the famous church.
