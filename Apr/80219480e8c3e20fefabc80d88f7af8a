A man who had unlawful carnal knowledge of two girls, aged 11 and 12 and who was eventually jailed for life by a high court for the offence has had his name and photograph posted on the Sex Offenders Register of the Ekiti State Ministry of Justice, it was gathered on Saturday. This is the second time in two weeks that two young men who forcefully slept with young girls and who were eventually jailed for life would have their pictures and names published in the Sex Offenders Register of the Ekiti State Government. On Saturday, the Ekiti State Ministry of Justice displayed the photograph of the man, whose name was given as Hussein Isah, and who was said to have forcefully slept with the two girls, whose ages were put at 11 and 12 years old. The 33-year-old Isah, a native of Ayangba in the Dekina Local Government Area of Kogi State, was said to have committed the act in Ilasa Ekiti, a community in Ekiti State where he was residing and was subsequently arrested. He was said to be a co-tenant to the mother of the 11-year-old girl while the other victim, aged 12 years, is a friend to the 11-year-old. He used to send them on errands before eventually deciding to commit the act. Foolwing his arrest and arraignment, he was subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment by the trial judge, Justice Lekan Ogunmoye of the Ekiti State High Court and he is currently serving his life jail term at the Nigerian Correctional Centre, Ado Ekiti, the Ekiti State capital. The display of his name and photo on the Sex Offenders Register was announced by the state Ministry of Justice on its Facebook wall on Saturday.
