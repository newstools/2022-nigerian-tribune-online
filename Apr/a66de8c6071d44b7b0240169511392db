No fewer than four occupants of a tricycle, on Saturday, escaped death by the whiskers in a ghastly accident at Orerokpe Express Road, in Okpe Local Government Area of Delta State. A witness, who simply identified as Rachel, said she was standing beside the express road to board a commercial vehicle to Eku Market when the accident happened. “It was a clean Lexus saloon car, coming from Osubi that brushed and flung the tricycle from the road while it was overtaking at high speed. “The tricycle somersaulted several times before it finally came to a halt,” she narrated. It was gathered that the tricycle was damaged beyond repair, while onlookers helped to drag the passengers and their belongings out of the mangled tricycle. It was learnt that among the passengers was an aged woman who was bleeding and shivering as a result of the incident.
