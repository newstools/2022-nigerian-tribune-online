The head of Business Development First City Micro Finance Bank (FCMFB), Mr Friday Nwokolo, has tasked the pupils of Olunde Community Secondary School Ijogbin, Oyo State and school pupils in general to be good ambassadors of their state by shunning negative attitudes that will hinder them from attaining their true life goals. He noted that engaging in social vices and other forms of unruly behaviour should not be found within them. He said this during the 2022 annual inter-house sports competition of the school where he is a sponsor of one of the houses, Purple House. Purple House won the best-behaved house award.  In his speech at the event, he “admonished parents and teachers to ensure they take care of their children because they are the leaders of tomorrow.” He asked parents who have the means to also support the school and other forms of curricular activities. These children’s success does not belong to the school alone but also to their parents. He promised to give financial aid to children who come first to the third position during the just concluded examination. Nwokolo in his elated mood thanked the students of Purple house for making him proud by winning the award. The school principal Mr Adesina also thanked parents and the sponsors for making the event memorable for the school.
