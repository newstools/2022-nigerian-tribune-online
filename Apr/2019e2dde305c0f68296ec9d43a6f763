The Women Affairs Minister, Dame Pauline Tallen, on a condolence visit to the family of the late popular gospel singer, Osinachi Nwachukwu, at her home at Arco Estate, Abuja, on Monday, vowed to get justice for the late ‘Ekwueme’ crooner who was alleged to have died as a result of gender-based violence (GBV) perpetrated by the husband, as well as full protection for the children left behind by the late singer. Even though reports had it that the late singer was hospitalised for throat cancer disease before her death, social media claims would just not go away that she suffered GBV in the hands of her husband. Dame Tallen who asked for a private session with the children of the deceased disclosed that her findings compelled her to make the demands for justice for her and protection for the children for the things they disclosed to her away from prying eyes. Presently, the children of the deceased were being cared for by a family friend, Mr Sunday Achino, from the Church where the late singer worshipped – Dunamis Church.
