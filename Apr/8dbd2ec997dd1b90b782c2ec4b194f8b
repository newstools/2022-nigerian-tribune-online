I am a 40-year old driver. I recently noticed a bulge in my right groin whenever I stand up. However, the bulge disappears when I lie down. Kindly let me know if this is a Hernia and what I can do to Perry (by SMS)  It very much looks like a hernia. The best thing to do is to see a Medical Doctor who will examine you and advise you on the right time for you to come for surgery to remove the hernia.
