Association of Resident Doctors (ARD) University of Jos Teaching Hospital has lamented the recurring incident of abduction of its members and threatened to withdraw its services if the incident persisted. Addressing newsmen after its protest against the incident in Jos, the President of the Association Dr Noel Nnaegbuna strongly condemned the abduction of his members adding that two were recently abducted apart from the past ones that were kidnapped. According to him, the recent occurrences have caused untold mental, psychological, physical and emotional trauma to his members and their families adding that the incidences have continued to hinder members of the association from giving their best at their point of duty. ” We want to express our displeasure in the terms, of the recent incidents of abduction of our members and the seemingly unacceptable response of the security architecture of the state in bringing a stop and lasting solution to this menace. Our worrisome concern is the abduction of two of our members in the last three weeks” Dr Nnaegbuna said the Association would have down tools but for the sake of innocent Nigerians who need health care services, it rescind the decision but resorted to a peaceful demonstration to convey its displeasure. The President of ARD, however, threatened that if the incident continued, the association cannot guarantee continued interruption of service delivery.  Dr Nnaegbuna, therefore, called on the government at all levels to expedite actions in tackling the menace and assured the members that the association will put more pressure on the relevant agencies to see that the situation is brought to a halt.
