An aspirant for the Federal House of Representatives seat in Ibadan North East/South East federal constituency, Ibrahim Ajiboye a.k.a omo iya eleja, has said that the time is ripe to displace social media politicians as the race to occupy various electoral positions in the 2023 general elections thickens. Ajiboye stated this during the official declaration of his intention to represent the people of Ibadan North East/South East federal constituency which was held at the Oke-Adu area of Ibadan, the Oyo State capital at the weekend. He noted that: “People like us, I mean myself and other good young men and women, It is high time we dabbled into politics because if you look at the situation right now, we are having a very bad representation. Most of the people who hold political offices at the moment are internet politicians, they are social media politicians and some of us who have voters cards use them as means of identification at banks and the like. “So we look at the way things are in the country, the economy is not the way it should be and that is as a result of the selection of the people that are representing us at all angles right from the councillor up to the president. Therefore, people like us look at it that Nigeria has to be better. “We have travelled abroad, we have lived here before we travelled abroad, we know an integral part of the sufferings of the Nigerian people and therefore, I deem it fit to actually come out as a youth to make sure we have a better nation, we have a good representation and my type of politics is all-inclusive politics. It is a participatory politics, it is the type that does not only represent a political party, but it is also a politics whose representation represents all the people in the geographical location.” IN CASE YOU MISSED THESE FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE
