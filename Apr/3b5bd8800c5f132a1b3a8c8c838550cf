The Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Oyo State, Mr Isaac Omodewu has refuted the claim that he masterminded the arrest and detention of a member of the party in the Ibadan Southwest local government area, one Mr Sunday Babalola. Omodewu described the rumour making the rounds over his alleged involvement in the arrest and detention of a member of the party as a calculated attempt to malign his image. It, thereby, urged members of the party to disregard such news, saying it was nothing but an attempt to give a dog a bad name. According to him, “I was not aware of any arrest. I didn’t report anybody. It would be recalled that the said member was arrested in Ibadan yesterday, owing to an alleged leadership tussle in the council area. The said man isn’t a known person isn’t known to me and hasn’t offended me.  Anybody who said that I ordered anybody’s arrest or wrote any petition should come forward. So why should I order his arrest? “I am concerned about reconciliation in our party. So why would I order anybody’s arrest even if the person offended me? I am the party chairman in the state and I don’t see a reason why anybody would link me with such. “Be that as it may, I have asked my people to see the police to further get clarification on what truly transpired. “I also want to appeal to all APC members to see themselves as one and forget what might have happened among them in the past. We are poised for victory in the coming polls and we should not allow anything to distract us.” IN CASE YOU MISSED THESE FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE
