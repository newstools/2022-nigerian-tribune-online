In order to maintain peace and tranquillity in Oyo State before, during and after the Christian festive season of Easter, police operatives in the state command continued their patrol of hotspots in Ibadan on Thursday. The patrol is also for the security of lives and property during the ongoing annual fasting (Ramadan) by Muslims and the marking of Eid-el Fitr at the end. Police operatives, alongside men of Amotekun Corps, patrolled areas like Challenge, New Garage, Molete, Idi-Arere, Bere, Gate, Iwo Road and Mokola, said to be prone to violence. The patrol exercise, which began on Monday, is being held simultaneously across the state.  Speaking with newsmen after Thursday’s patrol, the state Commissioner of Police, Ngozi Onadeko, said the essence of the patrol was to ensure that the state remains safe, and that, police officers could quickly respond to any threat that could cause the breakdown of law and order. The police boss said that the operatives, with Amotekun Corps, would continue the exercise, especially in the build-up to the festive seasons. She said: “Area Commanders, heads of tactical formations and Divisional Police Officers (DPOs) have also been mandated to increase layers of supervision for officers on the field, conduct effective stop-and-search, engage in visibility policing patrols along with major highways/boundary points, in addition to intelligence-led raids of black spots and convoy patrols with relevant agencies and non-state actors.” Onadeko, therefore, charged residents of the state to cooperate with the police by providing necessary information that would lead to the arrest of criminal elements before crimes are committed.
