The Federal Government has said that the use of labour-based technology in the construction and maintenance of public works boosts employment in the country. The Minister for Labour and Employment, Dr Chris Ngige, stated this as he flagged off the seventh meeting of the National Employment Council in Abuja, with the theme, ‘Use of labour-based technology in the construction and maintenance of infrastructure.’ He noted that the use of labour-based technology in constructing and maintaining public infrastructure had the capacity to enhance the employment and socio-economic wellbeing of Nigerians. Ngige, represented by Director, Employment and Wages, John Nyamali, said that the introduction and expansion of labour-based methods in public works not only had the capacity of generating more employment in the country, but also had a cost advantage over technology-based methods. The Minister stated that the evolution from the conventional skills and labour orientation to technology orientation in work had posed a threat in employment, as technology took jobs away. According to him, “The labour-based method of construction, rehabilitation and maintenance of infrastructure is formulated to reduce the impacts of technology on employment.” Ngige stated that labour-based methods had “a significantly higher employment creation potential when compared with equipment-based methods,” adding that the labour-based public works projects in the country were aimed at reducing unemployment. He said the council would review what had been done by the relevant agencies of government and operators in the sector, and make contributions that would improve the labour-based technology in public works project in Nigeria. The Minister further stated that the National Directorate of Employment (NDE) would brief the council on its efforts towards widening the understanding of, and acceptance of labour-based technology by stakeholders, while the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing would present a memorandum for the council’s consideration.
