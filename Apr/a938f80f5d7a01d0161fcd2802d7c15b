Nigerian Disc Jockey, Unstoppable Dj Nero has joined the leading voices advocating for children born with Clubfoot deformity. Clubfoot is a birth deformity that affects one or both feet of a child after childbirth. The congenital birth defect causes one or both feet of the child to bend inward and downward, causing the leg to form a “hockey stick” shape. According to medical experts, about 4 in 1,000 live births will have clubfoot complications globally. About fifty percent of individuals with clubfoot often have deformities on both feet — causing mild to severe pains — making the individual walk with a lopsided gait.  While the exact cause of clubfoot has not yet been determined, it is believed that it is caused by genetic and environmental factors.
