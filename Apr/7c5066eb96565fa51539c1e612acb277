Twitter has announced it will soon start experimenting with an edit button, a long-awaited demand of users, but only on its monthly subscription service at first, Aljazeera has reported. The inability to tweak tweets after firing them off has been a key complaint among users of the one-to-many messaging platform. Word that the company would start testing an edit feature on Twitter Blue came after newly named board member Elon Musk conducted an online poll. In a tweet, Musk asked if people wanted an edit button on Twitter. Nearly 4.4 million votes were cast, some 73 per cent of them saying “yes”. “Now that everyone is asking … yes, we’ve been working on an edit feature since last year,” Twitter posted on its communications account. “No, we didn’t get the idea from a poll,” it added, poking fun at the Tesla boss.

They currently work around this by deleting and tweeting again,” Sullivan said in a tweet thread. The San Francisco-based internet firm said it will kick off testing in coming months to figure out what works when it comes to letting users tinker with posts after they have gone live. Twitter Blue lets people pay a monthly subscription fee of $3 to access special content or features. Blue is available on the Twitter application for Apple or Android smartphones in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States, according to the company.  (Aljazeera)
