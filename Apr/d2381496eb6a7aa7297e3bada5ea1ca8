On the occasion of the 70th birthday of the former national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, the Edo State Chairman of the APC, Col David Imuse (rtd) has described the former Edo State governor as an accomplished labour leader, activist and public administrator. In a congratulatory message Monday in Benin, Col. Imuse said that the ex-president of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) is worth celebrating at 70 for his life of consistent commitment to the public good, having contributed positively to labour development, as well as politics and development of Edo State and the Nigerian nation. The Edo State chairman of the ruling party further described the septuagenarian as a legend who, after he left footprints in labour joined politics to become a major contributor to the success story of the nation’s democratic dispensation, first as the executive governor of Edo State and later as national chairman of the APC. Col Imuse praised the ex-comrade governor on his 70th birthday, for being the brain behind several monumental, impactful and indestructible initiatives, which dot the Edo landscape, especially during his tenure as Edo state governor. Col Imuse expressed the joy of the party membership in the state on the occasion of the Comrade’s birthday as they join family, friends, and professional and political associates to celebrate his platinum jubilee.
