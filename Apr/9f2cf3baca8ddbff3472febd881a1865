Kaduna State workers offered special prayers at Sardauna Memorial College Juma’a Mosque, Kaduna, seeking God’s intervention for workers in the state. At his weekly Friday sermon, the chief Imam Mallam Liman Sani used the occasion to pray for workers, asking God to touch the hearts of the leaders to have mercy on the workers, as well as to improve their living conditions. The Imam also prayed for peace, unity and development of the state and the country at large. Leading the delegation, the chairperson of the Nigeria Labour Congress(NLC) Kaduna State Council, Comrade Ayuba Magaji Suleiman said a similar prayer was observed last Sunday at a church in the state. He said the prayers were for the working class, to have a hitch-free May Day celebration, as well as to succeed in the various struggles the leadership of the congress is embarking on behalf of the workers. Suleiman called on workers to dedicate themselves to their work for the development of the state.  Part of the activities lined up for the May Day celebration is a symposium, prayers at church and mosque, with the final fanfare to be observed on May 1st, at Ahmadu Bello Stadium, Kaduna.
