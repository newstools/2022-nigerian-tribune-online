President Muhammadu Buhari has joined leaders and members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in celebrating with former Governor of Edo State, Comrade Adams Aliyu Oshiomhole, on his 70th birthday, coming up on Monday. A statement issued by Femi Adesina, Special Adviser to the President (Media & Publicity) on Sunday said the President congratulated the former Chairman of the APC on another milestone, saluting his salutary contributions to the development of democracy and good governance. President Buhari expressed his belief that Oshiomhole’s leadership strides in various sectors will stand the test of time, deploying his time and strength to the good of workers and Nigerians as a labour leader, Chairman of the Nigerian Labour Congress, and accepting the call into politics to serve his state. He notes the mental soundness and experience of the former APC leader, willingly dedicating himself to the greater good of the country, and acting as the voice of the voiceless in different ramifications. As the former Governor turns 70, the President prayed for good health and continued service to God and humanity.
