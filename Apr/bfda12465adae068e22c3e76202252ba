Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State has called on Muslim faithful in the state and the country at large to intercede on behalf of the county as the Radaman commences. Akeredolu, in a statement signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Richard Olatunde, lamented over the insecurity in the country, charged the Muslim faithful to seek God’s intervention to guide the leadership of the country in the fight against terrorism and banditry. The governor said “As you commence the Ramadan today, let us collectively seek Allah’s face particularly on the insecurity situation in our country. We believe in God and with him, nothing is impossible. “Let us intercede on behalf of the country. The recent invasion of the Kaduna Airport by terrorists and train attack which led to the death of many innocent souls was a national disaster. “It reminded us of the need to join hands and do all we can to end this cankerworm called insecurity. “This Ramadan is an opportunity for a fresh start. Little act of kindness and help for the needy would go a long way to remind our people that they live in a society filled with love. We must strive to show love to our neighbors.” IN CASE YOU MISSED THESE FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE Akeredolu also urged Muslims to use this Radaman to pray for a successful 2023 general election. “We congratulate the Muslims in the sunshine state for witnessing the beginning of yet another Ramadan fasting.

Let us join our voices to pray for Ondo State and Nigeria at large,” he said.
