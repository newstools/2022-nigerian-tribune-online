Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom on Tuesday reiterated his directive to the people of the state to rise up and defend themselves. Ortom stated this while reacting to the killing of 25 people by herders in some parts of the state on Monday night. Ortom in a statement made available by his media aide, Nathaniel Ikyur said “it is becoming increasingly glaring every day that my people are now an endangered specie and so, we can no longer wait for help from anywhere. My people will have to rise up to the occasion to defend themselves and their heritage against the Fulani army of occupation.” He added: “We are law-abiding citizens. We have cried for help against these invaders but nothing is forthcoming. We are left alone and it looks like it is a deliberate strategy. Now, we have only one option; to defend ourselves or get extinct. This is a case for our survival. “We have been accommodating other people in our land but our hospitality is misconstrued as weakness. We are not a conquered people. We will never be. We are free-born citizens of Nigeria.” He called on security operatives to do more in crime prevention and protection of lives and property in the land just as he urged the people to cooperate with security agencies to flush out the undesirable elements in the society. The governor further said that his administration will not shy away from its commitment to providing welfare and security for the citizens. IN CASE YOU MISSED THESE FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE
