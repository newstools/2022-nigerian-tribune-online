MUSLIM residents of Kupola in Egbeda/Ona Ara Federal Constituency of Oyo State have lauded the inauguration of a mosque in the community. People from various walks of life gathered to witness the inauguration of the mosque which was built by an indigene of the community, Major-General Asimiyu Adebayo Olaniyi, a former officer commanding (OC), in honour of the late Alhaji Salami Adeniran Adeyilola and the late Alhaji Rauf Olaniyi  Adeyilola. Speaking at the event, General Olaniyi said the mosque was built for the propagation of Islam and to seek Allah’s blessing for the souls of the deceased. “I am indeed happy because one of the things a child can do for their dead parents is to glorify God in their name. I urge the people to depend on God as He is the only support we have as humans and do our best for others for the love of God,” he said. A community leader, who spoke on behalf of other residents, expressed joy at having a modern mosque in the area and encouraged other well-to-do natives of the community to emulate such gesture. He described the mosque as a legacy that would outlive many generations, saying “people should do things that touch the lives of others.”  YOU SHOULD NOT MISS THESE HEADLINES FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE We Have Not Had Water Supply In Months ― Abeokuta Residents In spite of the huge investment in the water sector by the government and international organisations, water scarcity has grown to become a perennial nightmare for residents of Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital.
