AN Islamic scholar, Sheikh Muyideen Ibrahim, has called on Nigerians to be patriotic and live in love and harmony. Ibrahim, who was the guest speaker at the 2022 Ramadan lecture of a radio station, Jamz 100.1FM, noted that as a country, “we must go back to our Creator, Almighty Allah, so that things may get better for the country.” Speaking on the challenges facing Nigeria ahead of the 2023 general election, the scholar called on government to pay more attention to the yearnings of the people, “especially as they regard water and electricity, the lack of which are banes of the development of any growing nation at a time like this.” The lecturer also warned government against failure to diversify the nation’s economy, saying a nation without development would have its people suffering.  He also appealed to Nigerians to exercise patience, saying with support for government programmes, the nation would improve. Also, speaking, one of the special guests, popular preacher, Dr Dawood Amoo Alaga, called on Nigerians, irrespective of religion, to live together in peace and unity. He said no one should hate another person on the basis of religion, noting that “God has destined us to be in the religion we have found ourselves and so we must tolerate one another.” Dr Amoo advised politicians to have the fear of God and reflect that in the way they go about governing the people at all times. The General Manager of JAMZ 100.1FM, Mr Tony Awobode, encouraged Muslims to use the occasion of this year’s Ramadan to seek Allah’s mercy and gave the assurance that the lecture would continue and get better every year.
