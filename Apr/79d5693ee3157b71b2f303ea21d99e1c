Speculations around the presidential ambition of Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo are set to be brought to an end. This comes as some sources, on Sunday, specifically said that Osinbajo will declare for the presidency on Monday. Monday’s expected declaration was preceded by Osinbajo meeting with the members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Governors’ Forum on Sunday evening. Osinbajo had invited the APC governors for breaking off fast on Sunday, an avenue he used to gauge the governors’ dispositions about his presidential ambition. For weeks, Osinbajo has come under sustained pressure from his supporters to run for presidency. The meeting with the governors is seen as hitting the crescendo in the series of consultations that Osinbajo had been having with various stakeholders regarding vying for Presidency. Osinbajo has in recent weeks become more visible on the road, apparently to feel the pulse of stakeholders and is said to now be convinced to make an announcement. IN CASE YOU MISSED THESE FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE Before now, there have been doubts as to whether Osinbajo will join the race following the early declaration of former Lagos State governor, Senator Bola Tinubu. Many had wondered whether Osinbajo would dare to compete as Tinubu perceived to be his political godfather. However, some other sources, close to the Vice President, maintained that though Osinbajo is bound to declare for presidency, they would not want to be specific about the particular day of declaration. The expected declaration comes after much speculation over the purported move and several push backs by Osinbajo’s aides and close associates. Times without number, Osinbajo’s spokesperson, Laolu Akande had rejected reports of the vice president’s impending declaration, often describing them as false and speculative. Akande had maintained that any information about it would come from him and not the media.
