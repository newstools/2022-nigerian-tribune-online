Anxiety as Justice Taiwo Taiwo of the Federal High Court in Abuja allowed legal fireworks by lawyers in the defection matter involving governor Ben Ayade of Cross River State over his defection from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to All Progressives Congress (APC), thereby putting the judgement on hold. The judge put the judgment on hold following a letter by the counsel to the governor, Chief Mike Ozekhome (SAN), who claimed to be drawing the attention of the court to a judgment of the Enugu Division of the Court of Appeal. Although, the Judge had slated this morning to deliver the judgement, but had to order counsel in the matter to address him on the implications of the appellate court’s judgment on the present case. At the time of fling this report, Counsel to the PDP, Emmanuel Ukala (SAN) which instituted the case against Ayade, was addressing the court. Justice Taiwo also ordered Ozekhome to make a case for Ayade while lawyer to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) will follow. It is, however, not clear if the judge will proceed to deliver the judgment after being addressed by the lawyers in the matter.
