An Alagbado Customary Court in Lagos, Lagos State has dissolved the marriage of a 50-year old civil servant, Mr Kayode Akinlotan to his wife, Elizabeth Akinlotan for lack of love. According to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), the court president, Mr Emmanuel Ali, held that their marriage had broken down irretrievably after both parties stayed apart for four years. Ali ordered the petitioner, Kayode, and the respondent, Elizabeth, to go their separate ways after 20 years of marriage. He advised both parties to approach a Family Court for the custody and welfare of the three children produced by their union. He ordered the petitioner and the respondent to maintain peace. Kayode filed for divorce on October 8, 2021. In a five-count claim, he said that Elizabeth was violent, disrespectful and adulterous. Kayode also said that Elizabeth did not care for him anymore, adding that she abused, disgraced and embarrassed him. He told the court that Elizabeth went to his place of worship in Abeokuta to cause trouble. Responding, Elizabeth said she was not violent, but admitted hitting Kayode once with a stool after he refused to open the door to their apartment when she returned late from work. She added that the petitioner never bought complete baby items anytime she put to bed. She told the court that she no longer loved her husband.
