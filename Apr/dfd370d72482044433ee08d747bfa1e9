Tragedy struck on Sunday night as a suspected drunk policeman killed two guests and injured others at a birthday party in the Gowon Estate area of Lagos State. The Nigerian Tribune gathered that the yet-to-be-identified policeman had been invited by the celebrant to his birthday as security guard at a club in the area. The police in the state confirmed the incident and added that efforts had been put in place to identify, arrest and prosecute the runaway killer policeman. A Twitter user, @themannaman had shared the gory video of the sad incident and explained that the police man actually wanted to shoot into the air. The Twitter user wrote on his handle that “Same policemen, called for security, are the same people that shot and killed those they were called to protect…Nigeria which way.” He also wrote that “birthday celebrant invited the police for security. The said policeman allegedly while drunk wanted to shoot upwards, then accidentally shot at them.”  IN CASE YOU MISSED THESE FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE The killer policeman was reportedly trying to show off and impress the birthday celebrant when he miscued and fired gunshots into the guests who were dancing. Two persons have since been arrested in connection with the incident after the owner of the bar reported it at the Gowon Estate police station. The image-maker in charge of the state police command, Benjamin Hundeyin, confirmed the incident but said that he had not been fully briefed on what actually happened at the event. The Lagos police spokesperson said: “I can confirm there was shooting at the bar on Sunday night and two persons were killed. We are investigating the circumstances that led to the shooting. I can assure you that those responsible will not go free.” He also added that “they will face the music. The Commissioner of Police Lagos State, CP Abiodun Alabi has zero-tolerance for such behaviours and has already given marching orders to the DPO to fish out the culprits.”
