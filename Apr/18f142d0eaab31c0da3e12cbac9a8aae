The attack it was gathered occurred on Sunday night when the bandits clad in military uniform stormed Shiyar Namada area of the town.

Thus, the residents didn’t bother to raise alarm leaving the bandits to operate at their will . Findings gathered that the commissioner’s son, who was sitting at the front their house during the break of fast with others when the bandits surfaced could not run as the hoodlums opened fire at them killing them on the spot. “During the attack most people observing Tarawih prayer in several mosques around the area and residents had to flee to safety. A source on Monday morning who shed more light on the attack said as I’m talking to you this morning I’m at the Waziri’s residence where preparations for their funeral are underway,” However, it was gathered that the attack might also be a reprisal attack as suspected bandit, who was seen at the outskirt of the town last Friday, was beheaded by the local vigilante otherwise known as Yan Sakai. As at the time of filing the report, the state police Command or the state government are yet to react on the Incident .
