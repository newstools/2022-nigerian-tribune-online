President Muhammadu Buhari has joined Kwara State Traditional Council and Ilorin Emirate Council in celebrating with the Emir of Ilorin, His Royal Highness, Justice Ibrahim Kolapo Sulu-Gambari, on his 82nd birthday, coming up Friday. According to a statement by Femi Adesina, Special Adviser to the President (Media & Publicity) on Thursday, President Buhari rejoiced with the eminent jurist, who he observed, served the country variously as Permanent Secretary and Solicitor-General, Gongola State, 1976; acting Judge, High Courts of Bauchi, Borno and Gongola States, 1977; Judge, High Court of Borno State, 1978-83 and Justice, Court of Appeal, 1983. The statement noted that before accepting the revered position of Emir of Ilorin in 1995, the President affirmed that Justice Sulu-Gambari left a legacy of integrity, decency and discipline in Nigeria’s judiciary, and continues to inspire a new generation on the pathway to greatness and honour, beyond his domain. As the traditional ruler turns 82, President Buhari also noted his modernising vision and contemporary outlook on national issues, including sports, sharing his experience with leaders, encouraging indigenes and citizens to uphold the unity of the nation and promote values that reflect fear of God, and love for others. The President prayed that the Almighty God will grant the Emir of Ilorin good health and strength.
