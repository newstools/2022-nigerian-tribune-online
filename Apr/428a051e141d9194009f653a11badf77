Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State has charged Christians to get involved in politics, which he said would help restore the glory of Nigeria. Speaking  when he received in audience, members of the Knight of St. Mulumber, Abuja Ecclesiastical Council led by the Metro Grand Knight, Sir Michael Awuhe on Friday, the governor described as wrong, the impression that politics is a dirty game. He also called on Christian leaders to encourage their members to come out and register in the ongoing registration exercise. Ortom said with the state of things in the country, Nigeria is already in a war situation. He said,  “Nigeria is in a war situation as we speak. “Those Christians who are sitting on the fence saying that politics is dirty are wrong. They should step forward and take their positions and show interest to bring the country back on track. “Now it is time for the validation of voters cards, let us mobilise our people to register so they can vote in the elections, adding, “Christians should unite as a church and be prepared because terrorists have surrounded the country.” Ortom appreciated  Catholic Church for  keeping faith with the work of God and described them as one of the most organised Christian denominations. While acknowledging the support of the Catholic Church had shown  to him through  their counsel, Ortom said the support  had been of immense benefits to him.
