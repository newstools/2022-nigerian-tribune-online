He said the family members were shocked when the bricklayer could not be reached on phone for hours, which rolled into days and weeks. “When we contacted alfa to ask about our brother’s whereabouts, we were surprised to hear him say that our brother did not come to his house. The matter was immediately reported to the police at Iyara Divisional Headquarters,” the elder brother said. Muideen explained that when the police stormed his residence, the alfa had taken to his heels, but the operatives arrested his father.

The family’s lawyer, Amos Oghinan, said that the suspect had been transferred to the state headquarters in Lokoja, saying the suspect remained adamant. Oghinan expressed worry about the police’s delay in charging the suspect to court. “Already, the alfa is overstaying his visit to the police headquarters. Any human rights organisation can complain about unlawful and long detention. To avoid this, the police should charge the case to court,” he said. Meanwhile, the Kogi state police spokesman, William Aya, disclosed to newsmen on Tuesday that the suspect has been arrested and he will soon appear in court.
