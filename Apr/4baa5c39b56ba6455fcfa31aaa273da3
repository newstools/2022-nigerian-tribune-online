At exactly 3:30 pm, on Thursday, gunmen stormed Ekwulobia town in Aguata local government area secretariat in Anambra State and set the council complex ablaze. This is coming about 24 hours after Governor Charles Soludo announced the appointment of a 15-man truth, peace and justice committee to look into all forms of agitations and killings in the South East. Though it is not clear the true picture of what happened, an eyewitness had it that the gunmen stopped in front of the local government headquarters, blocked the Ekwulobia-Ugah road and opened fire. It was gathered that the gunmen had earlier entered the secretariat, and chased away the local government workers before setting the place ablaze.

But officers and men of the state fire service stormed the area swiftly to put out the inferno at the time of this report. It would be recalled that Gov Charles Soludo had last Sunday granted amnesty to some members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) being held under custody at the correction centre in Anambra State. Soludo had earlier urged the gunmen to hand in their guns in line with the amnesty arrangements.
