THE Director-General of the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA), Dr Bashir Jamoh has noted that a well-regulated barge operating industry in the maritime sector is critical to ending gridlocks on port access roads in Nigeria. The NIMASA DG stated this when he played host to the Barge Operators Association of Nigeria (BOAN) led by the President, Hon. Bunmi Olumekun at the head office of the Agency in Lagos. “Barge operations have helped to reduce gridlocks in Apapa, as they are involved with the transportation of container goods from one point to another within the inland waters, thereby putting less pressure on our roads, while also contributing their quota to national economic development”, Jamoh remarked. Speaking further, the NIMASA DG urged the operators to invest in state of the art barges that can enable them to compete favourably with their foreign counterparts, as this will help them to remain in business and protect them from foreigners taking over their jobs. Furthermore, he disclosed that the Agency had begun the wreck removal exercise across the country, in line with the directive and approval of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) in order to ensure the channels are free for navigation, while also avoiding accidents on the waterways.

Earlier in his address, the President of the association, Hon. Bunmi Olumekun acknowledged the efforts of the Agency in carrying out its mandate for the growth and development of the Nigerian maritime sector. He pledged the continuous support of the association and cooperation with the Agency towards the realization of the three-point agenda of the current administration.
