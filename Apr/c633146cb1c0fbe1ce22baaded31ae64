Gunmen suspected to be Bandits terrorising Mangu local government area of Plateau State have abducted the wife and daughter of the State Commissioner of Environment, Usman Bamaiyi. It was gathered that the gunmen stormed the residence of the Commissioner in Gindiri in the early hour of Saturday and abducted both the wife and daughter at a gun point and whisked them to an unknown destination. A source close to the community disclosed that the gunmen gained access to the residence without being noticed by other family members residing in the house and those in the neighbourhood. The entire Mangu local government has been under the siege of these elements for sometimes as there is no week without reported cases of kidnapping and other social vices. Recall that a similar incident occurred in the same Gindiri community of Mangu Local Government Area where an elderly woman with her daughter were abducted along with two pastors. The Commissioner is also one of the aspirants contesting for the Mangu-Bokkos Federal Constituency seat in House of Representatives on the platform of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). The Plateau State Police Command who confirmed  the incident through its spokesperson, ASP Gabriel Ubah said men of the Command are already on the trail of the abductors to ensure safe rescue and release of the victims.
