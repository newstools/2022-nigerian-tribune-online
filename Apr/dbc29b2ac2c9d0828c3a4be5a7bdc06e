The member representing the Oluyole Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives, Tolulope Akande-Sadipe has commended the Federal Ministry of Works on the recent tender issued by Federal Roads Maintenance Agency (FERMA), for the rehabilitation of the Taska Junction, Tipper Garage to Ayegun Oleyo and Baare. Akande-Sadipe applauded the Minister of Works, Babatunde Raji Fashola and the Chairman House of Representatives Committee on FERMA, Bamisile Olufemi Richard for acknowledging her letter after her outburst on the decapitated condition of a road in her constituency. The lawmaker had in March 2021 written a letter to the Chairman House Committee on FERMA titled ‘Request for Road Construction on Taska Junction, Tipper Garage to ayegun oleyo to Baare Road, Oluyole, Oyo State.’ “I appreciate the fact that the Ministry under the leadership of Hon. Minister. Raji Fashola and the Chairman Ferma, Hon. Bamisile Olufemi Richard took into consideration our complaint last year, over the terrible conditions of the roads. “I hope the Ministry would ensure that competent and reputable contractors are given the project awarded in the tender published by Vanguard Newspaper on Monday, to be executed in the full sum as stated in the 2022 budget,” she added. Akande Sadipe also noted that this road would come as a relief to the commuters who ply the route daily and would as well improve their standard of living.
