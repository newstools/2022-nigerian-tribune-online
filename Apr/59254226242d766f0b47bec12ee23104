No fewer than forty countries will be represented during the Food and beverage exhibition billed to hold in Lagos in June this year. Already the largest food and beverage exhibition in Sub-Saharan Africa, the post-pandemic demand for in-person trade events means FAB West Africa 2022 is having to expand into new exhibition space at the Landmark Centre on Victoria island. This could make it the largest food and beverage exhibition on the African continent. More than 220 exhibitors from over 40 countries will be taking part and over 5,000 visitors are expected to come to FAB West Africa 2022. The show, which runs from Tuesday 14th June to Thursday 16th June, will also be the first exhibition to use the new third hall at the Landmark Centre. FAB West Africa is being organised by BtoB Events, with Just Food and NASCO group as Gold Sponsors are. FAB West Africa’s success derives from the extensive opportunities it provides to find out about the latest food and drink developments and to sample products being launched in Nigeria and the region. A number of country pavilions will showcase international ranges. BtoB Events Managing Director Jamie Hill says: “After the huge success of FAB West Africa 2021, I cannot wait to bring the largest edition of the Food and Beverage West Africa exhibition back to Nigeria. This year’s exhibition has seen an incredible increase in demand for exhibition space and will host exhibitors from across 40 countries and 5 continents. “The previous edition back in September 2021 was a huge success, despite certain covid and travel restrictions. So for 2022, and the first edition since international travel was relaxed, we have seen a surge in demand for exhibition space. This exhibition will sell out so should you want to exhibit, get in touch today.”
