According to him, the strong revenue growth would have been impossible without the support of our customers and partners and we are immensely grateful.  The growth in net claims is also a reflection of our financial ability to meet the promise we made to policyholders. AXA Mansard Insurance continues to be an exceptional insurer with great financial strength and excellent underwriting capabilities. This has been shown over the years by the organization’s exceptional financial and technical capabilities.” Also speaking on the the results, the Chief Financial Officer, Mrs. Ngozi Ola-Israel,  said. “The business delivered strong growth across various indices, GWP grew 27% YoY from ₦47.58bn to 60.2b and improved underwriting efficiency underpinned by ₦9.23bn in underwriting profit, growing 24% YoY from ₦7.44bn. The decline of 4% and 17% respectively in the PBT and PAT is largely driven by fair values losses and non-recurrence of gain on disposal of a subsidiary in the previous year.
