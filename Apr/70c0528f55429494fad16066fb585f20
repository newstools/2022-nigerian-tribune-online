The Vice-Chancellor of Ladoke Akintola University of Technology (LAUTECH), Ogbomoso, Professor Mojeed Olaide Liasu, on Tuesday said the institution would strive to sustain and improve on its ratings by Webometrics, a world-renowned ranking body for universities. He said the recent ranking of LAUTECH by Webometrics as the best state university in Nigeria and its declaration as the fourth-best university in the country by the National Universities Commission (NUC) would spur the institution’s management to redouble its efforts in providing quality tertiary education to Nigerians. Addressing a press conference as part of the activities lined up for the 14 combined special convocation of LAUTECH in Ogbomoso, Liasu also hinted that “news filtering in from Webometrics also named our institution as the 9th best university in Nigeria in its latest ranking, dated March 11, 2022, in its ‘World Scientist and University Rankings’.” According to him, “our plan to have the 14 combined special convocation ceremonies of this university is a clear indication that we have witnessed tremendous improvement in our situation since the advent of Engr. Seyi Makinde’s administration to the point that we are able to think of convocations. “This convocation ceremony is made up of six sets 2015/2016, 2016/2017, 2017/2018, 2018/2019 2019/2020 and 2020/2021 academic sessions. I am sure that you all have followed up with events around our institution, particularly the not too palatable incident of our inability to hold convocation ceremonies since April 23, 2016, when the last one was held,” Liasu stated.

The Vice-Chancellor added that 12,023 graduands are graduating in the second-class lower degree cadre, and 3,221 graduands in the third class category while 299 finished with passes. While commenting on the lingering strike action by members of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), Liasu hinted that “if the industrial action persists, we would find out a solution at the local level in LAUTECH so that our students will not suffer the consequences of the strike.”
