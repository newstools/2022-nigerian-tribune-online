You will agree with me that Nigeria is in a social, political, and economic conundrum. There is gross insecurity, unemployment, overdependence on imports, perennial inflation, devaluation of the naira , fraud, corruption, gross national  debt, overdependence on oil revenue, terrorism, ethnic  division, extreme  poverty, mass illiteracy, etc. The greatest problem of Nigeria is mass illiteracy, which will continue to make Nigeria to remain an under-industrialised  country  of poor citizens, to be exploited rather perpetually by the mercenary or mercantilist or prebendal  politicians; unless, instead of 2023 elections, we have constitutional, institutional, policy reforms. A unitary system for a multi – ethnic, heterogeneous, illiterate and under- industrialised country simply cannot work. We need a confederal constitution or a very loose federal constitution. This is the message of Aare Afe Babalola, S.A.N The abrogation by the military of the 1963 federal and democratic constitution was unlawful, unconstitutional, null and void. The 1979 and the 1999 constitutions are constitutional force majeure, imposed under duress by the military. By the doctrine of necessity, it is lawful for the National Assembly, to recognise the 1963 constitution and begin the process of re-installation of that constitution, interim government. May God help Nigeria accordingly, otherwise the sufferings of Nigerians will increase.
