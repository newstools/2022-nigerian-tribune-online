I recently noticed that I couldn’t see well with my two eyes. After an examination by the doctor whom I saw, I was diagnosed with Glaucoma. Kindly educate me on Glaucoma. Silas (by SMS)  Glaucoma is a condition that damages your eye›s optic nerve. It gets worse over time. It›s often linked to a buildup of pressure inside your eye. Glaucoma tends to run in families. You usually don’t get it until later in life. The increased pressure in your eye, called intraocular pressure, can damage your optic nerve, which sends images to your brain. If the damage worsens, glaucoma can cause permanent vision loss or even total blindness within a few years. Most people with glaucoma have no early symptoms or pain. This is why it is usually advisable to visit your eye doctor regularly so they can diagnose and treat glaucoma before you have long-term vision loss. If you lose vision, it can’t be brought back.  But lowering eye pressure can help you keep the sight you have. Most people with glaucoma who follow their treatment plan and have regular eye exams are able to keep their vision. Your doctor may use prescription eye drops, oral medications, laser surgery, or microsurgery to lower pressure in your eye.
