Although I am already 16 years of age, however, unlike my friends I am very short. Kindly let me know the kinds of foods I should be eating so I can grow taller. Haruna (by SMS)  While height depends largely on genetics, getting enough nutrients in your diet is absolutely essential to ensuring proper growth and development. At 16 years of age, it is unlikely that your height can increase any more. However, despite having reached your maximum height, there are certain foods that can help you to maintain your height by keeping your bones, joints, and body healthy and strong. Protein, for instance, plays a key role in healthy development while also promoting tissue repair and immune function. Other micronutrients like calcium, vitamin D, magnesium, and phosphorus are involved in bone health, which is central to growth. All that is required of you is to eat a balanced daily meal consisting of the regular foods around you.
