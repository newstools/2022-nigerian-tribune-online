The National Open University of Nigeria (NOUN) is set for matriculation of more than 19,766 fresh students at its 22nd matriculation ceremony. A statement issued by the university spokesman, Malam Ibrahim Sheme, said the ceremony would  hold on Tuesday, 12th April, simultaneously across the 103 study centres of the university across the country. According to the statement, the matriculation that is expected to hold virtually would serve as a platform to formally welcome all freshmen admitted into the university for the 2021-2022 academic session. The Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Olufemi Peters, is expected to welcome the fresh students and matriculate them into the university. Sheme said this year’s ceremony is unique in the history of NOUN as it is the first time the institution is holding matriculation on a week day.
