I usually have hiccups at night just when I want to go to bed for the night. My last episode which happened a few days ago was very bad. It went on for about an hour and a half despite the water I gulped throughout the duration of the attack. Kindly let me know what to do. I am a 60 -year old man. Prince (by SMS)  When a hiccup forms, it is because of the voluntary contraction of the diaphragm at the same time as a contraction of the voice box, or larynx, and the total closure of the glottis, which is where the vocal cords are located. As a result, there is a sudden rush of air into the lungs, accompanied by the familiar “hic” sound. It can happen for no apparent reason. It is usually a minor nuisance, but prolonged hiccups can indicate a serious medical problem. Hiccups are medically known as synchronous diaphragmatic flutter or singultus. They can occur individually or in bouts. They are often rhythmic, meaning that the interval between each hiccup is relatively constant. Most people have hiccups from time to time, and they usually resolve without treatment within a few minutes. A cause of long-term hiccups is damage to or irritation of the vagus nerves or phrenic nerves, which serve the diaphragm muscle. Factors that may cause damage or irritation to these nerves include: a hair or something else in your ear touching your eardrum as well as a tumor, cyst or goiter in your neck. Hiccups that last for longer than 2 months are known as intractable hiccups. If a bout of hiccups lasts for longer than 48 hours, this is considered persistent, and the person should contact a doctor. This tends to be more common in men than women and could signify a more serious medical condition.
