NO fewer than 50 Muslim students of secondary schools across Kwara State have benefitted from a career mentorship programme sponsored by the state chapter of the Standard Bearers Islamic Organisation (SB). The programme also featured the award of free Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) and Senior School Certificate Examination (SSCE) forms to five students who excelled in the internal examinations conducted by the body. Speaking during the event held at the Islamic Welfare Foundation Hall, Ilorin, the state coordinator of SB, Abdulhafiz Adeagbo, said the essence of the programme was to motivate the students for academic excellence. “One of our objectives is the development of the students and youths to contribute to nation building. And one of the ways to achieve this is to make education accessible to them. That is why we are giving JAMB and other O’ level examination forms to the beneficiaries who excelled during our internal exams,” Adeagbo said. He advised the beneficiaries to use the programme to improve their focus on their educational pursuits. He described the programme as “a turning point in the lives of the students, considering the economic situation where parents sometimes abandon these examinations due to lack of money.” In a remark, a paediatric surgeon and immediate past state coordinator of the SB, Dr Nurudeen Abdulraheem, urged Muslim students to always strive to be the best wherever they find themselves. Such attitude and mentality, according to him, is consistent with Allah’s plans as stated in the Qur’an that Muslims are the best creation ever evolved for mankind. Two of the beneficiaries, Abdulsalam Nafisat and Shuaib Mohammed, on behalf of others, thanked the organisers for the opportunity and promised to use their future accomplishments for the advancement of Islam.
