The sacked Chief Imam of the Apo legislative Quarter mosque, Sheikh Nuru Khalid should be commended for his bravery even in the face of intimidation and sack for allegedly criticising President Muhammadu Buhari for his failure to put an end to the incessant killing of Nigerians. He got axed without being issued a query. This is the reason few people have the boldness to speak truth to power. Sheikh Khalid is a fearless man and vibrant Islamic cleric who did not entertain fear on what will happen to him for speaking the truth to those in position of authority. Like all Nigerians, Sheikh Khalid has been suffering in silence. But like other bold Nigerians, he cannot keep quiet again and the recent Kaduna train attack forced him to speaking on the ills of the society to the Federal Government without minding whose ox is gored.  What he did is in line with his assignment as a religious leader and I hope that others will follow and say the truth at all times so that this country can be a better place. It is good that he already has another assignment; this is proof that there is still hope for this country. Barrister Jimoh Mumin, Ibadan.
