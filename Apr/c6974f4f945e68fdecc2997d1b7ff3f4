The former Jigawa State governor and People Democratic Party (PDP) presidential aspirant, Alhaji Sule Lamido has debunked the Northern Elders’ report of shortlisting a consensus presidential aspirant for the party (PDP) in the region ahead of the 2023 general election. This was contained in a press statement issued, signed and made available to newsmen by him in Dutse, the state capital. The statement read, “The attention of key stakeholders of the PDP in the Northern State is drawn to reports in the media that some Northern Elders have shortlisted two of our prominent and deserving aspirants as consensus PDP Presidential Candidates.” According to the statement, “Having widely consulted Party Leaders across the 19 Northern States and FCT, it is hereby stated to our teeming party members and the general public that what is reported in the media is only the personal opinion of those who issued the statement and not the position of the PDP members in the North.” Alhaji Sule Lamido explained that “Discussions are ongoing with all the aspirants in our party with a view to having a National Consensus if possible or at least working towards having a smooth acrimony-free National Convention.” He emphasises that the position of the northern elders is not only injurious to the north but equally injurious to the northern aspirants.
