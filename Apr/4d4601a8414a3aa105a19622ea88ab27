Not many people of her age and privilege are blessed with the heart of giving, especially to those whom she doesn’t expect any favour in return from. This is the life current First Lady of Kogi State, Rashida Yahaya Bello, whose heart of gold and milk of kindness continue to endear her to many people within and outside the state. Despite being married to one of the country’s youngest serving governors, Yahaya Bello, Rashida has always been committed to a life of giving, hence the huge love she curries from different parts of the country. With a number of humanitarian services and give-back initiatives for thousands of youths, women empowerment programmes and taking care of the aged, Rashida appears to have wormed her way into the hearts of many, who constantly sing her praises for associating with them and giving their lives a meaning. Understanding that being in the position of power is transient, Rashida whose husband is currently aiming for the number seat of the country says she wants to keep using her resources to bless and make life meaningful for others.
