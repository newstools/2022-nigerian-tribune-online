A non-governmental organisation (NGO), A and A Medical Health Care Supply Aid, in collaboration with Spring of Salvation Church, has provided reading and prescription glasses, medical tests and treatment for different ailments to over 1,000 individuals in Ibadan as part of measures to improve universal health for all. Founder of A and A Medical Health Care Supply Aid, Mrs Abiola Akinremi, stated that the two-day free medical outreach was to ensure individuals could access basic healthcare, including health education on staying healthy. Akinremi, a registered nurse, said: “We believe everyone deserves basic healthcare. It is a basic necessity of life. That is why the medical outreach is organised to help people that cannot afford to seek care from health professionals. IN CASE YOU MISSED THESE FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE  “We have a lot of prescription and reading glasses; we know that it is expensive and not many people can afford it. For instance, it is important that children have glasses to see better what is written on the board and perform in school. “We want people to be healthy and strong. We want to educate people about their health. For example, people with diabetes that don’t check their blood sugar through the years could develop complications such as kidney problems and if they have a wound, it might not be able to heal. Even if you don’t have the money you should still have control over your lives through education. “This is sowing back into my country. A lot of other NGOs go to other countries but skip despite the great need. But I don’t want to do that, I want to be able to focus on Nigeria and help.” National Overseer, Spring of Salvation Church, Pastor Adesegun Oke, said the medical outreach will also contribute to improving the health of residents so that they can serve God effectively. He added: “Everything we do in the church takes a precedent from Jesus Christ, who brought healing and deliverance from sickness and illness.”
