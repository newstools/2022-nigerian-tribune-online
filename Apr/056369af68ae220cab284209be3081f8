Palpable fear has taken hold of the residents of the Ogwashi Uku community in the Aniocha South Council area of Delta State as at least five persons have been killed in renewed cult-related attacks. Tribune Online gathered that the fight for supremacy is between members of the Aye confraternity and Rubagger who have been hunting for each other. The victim of the latest killing on Wednesday night was one boy identified as Eze who was attacked along St Patrick road at about 7.30 pm. The report said the assailants trailed him to a nearby spot and immediately he left the place, the killers opened fire on him at close range.  As the bullets could not penetrate, sources said, the attackers used sticks to attack him. Confirming the report on Thursday, the state police public relations officer, DSP Bright Edafe said there was no open fight between the two cult members adding the attackers monitored their victims on the streets. “What they do is that they monitor their targets on the street. There hasn’t been any open attack, this makes it even much more difficult to get these bad elements.” He said the police were on top of the situation adding that all blackspots in the town would not be spared in the cause of investigation.
