Gunmen on Thursday evening invaded a cattle market in Igboukwu community, in Aguata Local Government Area, killing cows and goats in the market. Tribune Online gathered that the gunmen headed to Igboukwu after they left Ekwulobia, the headquarters of Soludo’s Local government council, where they burnt down structured and vehicles. A source in the area, Mr Iyke Orji confirmed the incident. In a Facebook post, Orji said: “The unknown firemen/gunmen after burning Aguata Local Government Secretariat, plied through Ekwulobia and headed straight to Igboukwu. “Stopping at Igboukwu gallop, there’s a cattle ranch where they sell over 30 cows by your right hand, those cows belong to an Igbo man. “These guys entered there, and killed all the cows belonging to an Igbo man.” A video trending on social media also showed slain cows littering the cattle market, with traders bemoaning their losses.
